/**
 * Unified accounts: one wallet behind several per-market connections.
 *
 * A user connects one API key as up to three legs (spot / USDT-M / COIN-M).
 * On a unified account every leg's `/balance` is the SAME wallet, so storing
 * each leg's answer under its own uuid counts the money once per leg — the
 * portfolio showed a Hyperliquid unified wallet twice and a Bitget UTA three
 * times. Bybit and OKX legs are `linkedTo` their spot leg when they are added;
 * a linked leg is never refreshed and reads the source's rows. This module
 * does the same for the families whose accounts can switch mode after they
 * were connected, so the link is re-derived from the venue instead of being
 * decided once at add time:
 *
 * - Hyperliquid — `userAbstraction` unifiedAccount / portfolioMargin.
 * - Bitget — Unified Trading Account.
 *
 * Classic accounts keep a separate wallet per product line and are unlinked.
