/**
 * The one place a stored credential is turned back into plaintext.
 *
 * Every read of `key` / `secret` / `passphrase` off a stored connection, and of
 * `secret` off a stored API key, should go through this module. Not because the
 * one-liner it replaces is long, but because three later changes each become a
 * single edit here instead of one edit per call site:
 *
 *   1. A blind index — a keyed fingerprint of the credential — so that dedupe
 *      can compare connections without unwrapping either of them. That is one
 *      change to `connectionMatches` rather than six near-identical rewrites
 *      spread over two resolver files.
 *   2. Binding the ciphertext to the account it belongs to, so a value lifted
 *      from one row cannot be replayed against another. This needs the
 *      connection in hand at unwrap time; `AbstractExchange`'s constructor
 *      never has it, and `resolveConnection(e)` always does.
 *   3. The `.find()` → sequential-loop restructuring that an asynchronous
 *      comparison forces. Solved once, in `findMatchingConnection`.
 *
 * There is deliberately no `resolveConnections(list)`. A list endpoint that
 * unwrapped every connection would turn one page load into N unwraps; the
 * connection list is the single hottest place this would show up. Resolve one
 * connection, when something actually needs its plaintext.
