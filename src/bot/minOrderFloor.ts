/**
 * Refusal of DCA orders that the exchange minimum would inflate.
 *
 * When a configured Base Order or Safety Order is below a pair's exchange
 * minimum, the sizing routines (`getBaseOrder`, `createInitialDealOrders`)
 * raise it to that minimum so the venue accepts it. That keeps the bot trading,
 * but the order it places can be several times what the user configured — a
 * 10.80 base order placed as 39.59 — which changes the strategy's position
 * sizing and risk without asking.
 *
 * By default a DCA bot now takes the other trade-off: it does not open the deal,
 * and says which order is too small and what the minimum is, so the user can
 * remove the pair, raise the sizes, or turn `allowRaiseToExchangeMin` on to go
 * back to raising. The sizing routines keep
 * sizing exactly as they always have; they only record, per order, the quantity
 * the configured size produced and the quantity after the exchange-minimum
 * raises ({@link MinOrderFloor}). The decision lives here, as plain functions
 * over plain numbers.
 *
 * Only the MINIMUM raises are recorded. Step rounding and COIN-M contract
 * rounding also move the quantity, but they are granularity, not a minimum —
 * they happen to every order on the pair whatever its size.
 */

/**
 * How far the exchange minimum may raise an order before the deal is refused.
 * Absorbs rounding next to the minimum (a short entry sized at the slippage
