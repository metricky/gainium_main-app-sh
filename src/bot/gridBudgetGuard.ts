/**
 * Minimum-budget guard for grid bots.
 *
 * A grid divides its budget across its levels. When the budget is too small,
 * the budget-derived size of one level falls below the exchange's per-order
 * minimum, and the sizing routine (`MainBot.generateGridsOnPrice`) raises every
 * level to that minimum. The grid — and the start order that pre-funds one side
 * of it — is then sized from the exchange minimum instead of from the budget,
 * and commits a multiple of what the user configured. On futures the start
 * order's balance check divides by leverage, so the inflated order passes.
 *
 * The sizing routine keeps sizing exactly as it always has; it only records
 * what it wanted and what the minimum was ({@link GridSizingReport}). The
 * decision lives here, as plain functions over plain numbers, so it can be
 * tested without an engine: sizing is linear in the budget, so the budget a
 * grid really needs is `budget × minimum / wanted`.
 *
 * Fail-open on anything unknown about the exchange (no usable minimum): that is
 * exactly the behaviour before this module existed.
