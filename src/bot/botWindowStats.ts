/**
 * Bot-level performance over a window of closed deals, derived from the deals
 * on read — the "Lifetime" and "Since last change" views of the Statistics tab.
 *
 * Why not `bot.stats`: that document is an incremental aggregate the engine
 * resets whenever a sizing setting or the profit currency changes
 * (`resetStatsAfter`), so the bot's history before the last change is gone
 * from it. The deals are not: folding them gives the lifetime figures back for
 * every existing bot with no migration, and the same fold with `from =
 * resetStatsAfter` gives the "since" figures.
 *
 * Population: the same as the per-pair stats (`pairStats.ts`) — closed /
 * canceled deals that ever filled, by CLOSE time, plus every open deal for the
 * capital they hold. A deal opened before a settings change and closed after
 * it counts in "since"; the engine's own `stats` drops it from both windows
 * (`botUpdateStats` returns early on `createTime < resetStatsAfter`).
 *
 * Money is USD (`profit.totalUsd`), so a profit-currency change does not make
 * the lifetime figures incomparable. Return and drawdown are measured against
 * the peak capital the bot ever had committed at once, not `startBalance`,
 * which is sizing-derived and would move with every sizing change.
