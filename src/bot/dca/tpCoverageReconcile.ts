/**
 * Does the deal's resting take-profit still cover the position it tracks?
 *
 * Spec `specs/013.tp-coverage-drift-after-partial-tp.md` (issue #696),
 * follow-up to #694.
 *
 * #694 fixed the path that *creates* this drift: `placeOrders` looked the
 * resting take-profit up with `status: 'NEW'` only, so a take-profit that had
 * taken a partial fill was invisible to it and the replacement was sent on top
 * of the still-live order. What that fix cannot do is repair the deals already
 * drifted — coverage is only ever re-established as a side effect of
 * `placeOrders`, which runs on a fill, so a deal whose coverage broke while the
 * path was broken stays broken until its next safety order happens to fill.
 * Three production deals were sitting that way on 2026-09-06, across three
 * users: B3-USDC `6a90e161…` with 110,493 B3 carrying no take-profit at all,
 * and CTSIUSDT `6a978104…` / DGBUSDT `691de676…` each resting two take-profits
 * that between them offered more base than the deal owned.
 *
 * Pure on purpose, and for the same reason as `positionReconcile`: the whole
 * decision is one piece of judgement reachable in production only behind a live
 * exchange round trip, and the fail-safe direction matters more than the happy
 * path. Cancelling a take-profit that was in fact covering the position leaves
 * a live position unprotected — strictly worse than the drift being repaired.
 * So every branch here is written to answer "covered" when it cannot prove
 * otherwise.

 * The part of a drift the engine's own fee handling cannot account for.

 * because the close sells `gross * (1 - fee)`, and grosses a short up by
 * `1 / (1 - fee)` for the mirror reason. `trackedPosition` measures the
 * position itself, so on a perfectly healthy deal the two differ by exactly
 * that factor — `tracked * fee / (1 - fee)`, the same magnitude in both
 * directions — and the check reported it as drift forever. Issue #700, spec
 * `014`: RUNE-USDC `6a9169e0…` rested `1151.1818 * 0.999 = 1150.0306` and was
 * reported `under` on every pass; APE-USDC `6a9168a9…` rested
 * `32550 / 0.999 = 32582.58` and was reported `over`.
 *
 * Subtracting the factor from `tracked` instead was rejected: which of
 * `getTPOrder`'s fee branches produced a given resting order is not knowable
 * from the deal (the quantity leg is zeroed on futures, zero for a `zeroFee`
 * key, and re-derived from quote profit on a `profitCurrency: base` deal), and
 * on the live fleet most in-scope deals rest a take-profit at exactly the
 * tracked position. A subtraction would have silenced one false family and
 * created another of the same shape in the opposite direction. A tolerance is
 * safe under every branch: it can only ever make this check report LESS.
 *
