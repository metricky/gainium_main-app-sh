 *  - **Quantity.** Spot pays the fee out of the asset received, so the TP
 *    quantity must be shaved on a long (or grossed up on a short). Futures
 *    charge margin in quote and never touch the position, so the quantity leg
 *    deliberately zeroes the fee.
 *  - **Price.** Both venue types need the TP (and the percentage SL) pushed out
 *    far enough to cover the round trip, futures included. This leg must read
 *    the venue's real fee, never the quantity leg's zeroed one.
 *
 * These live here as pure functions so the invariant is pinned by
 * `tpFees.spec.ts` rather than by a comment. Deriving the price displacement
 * from the zeroed quantity fee silently drops fee compensation on every
 * futures TP/SL, which is what happened between v1.14.17 and this file
 * (see `tpFees.spec.ts` for both regression cases).
