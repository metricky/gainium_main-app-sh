/**
 * A base order that stopped part-filled.
 *
 * `startDeal` — the only thing that gives a deal an average price, a cost, a
 * usage figure, a take-profit and a stop-loss — is reached exclusively from
 * `processFilledOrder`, so only a base order the engine holds as `FILLED` ever
 * opens a deal. A base order left `PARTIALLY_FILLED` therefore keeps its deal
 * in `start` indefinitely, even though the venue has already executed part of
 * it and the account is holding that position untracked.
 *
 * `checkBaseOrder` is the engine's answer to "the entry did not complete in
 * time", and both of its branches act only when the order is neither `FILLED`
 * nor `PARTIALLY_FILLED`. The enter-market branch is the LAST check a deal
 * gets — it clears the reposition timer on the way in and is itself the timer
 * that fired — so a partial fill seen there ends the deal's life as a thing
 * anything will look at again. There is no periodic sweep for `start` deals;
 * the bot's restore path is the only other visitor, and it runs once per start.
 *
 * The same stranding has a second, worse shape: the VENUE ends the order while
 * it is part filled, so the row goes straight to `CANCELED`/`EXPIRED` carrying
 * its executed quantity. `checkBaseOrder` cannot even be the one to notice,
 * because its timers are armed only for a LIMIT entry — a MARKET entry arms
 * nothing, and for it the order queue's cancel callback is the engine's whole
 * knowledge of the order.
 *
 * Specs `specs/038…` and `specs/048…`.
