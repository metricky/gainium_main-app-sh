/**
 * How a deal ended, in the words the user reads.
 *
 * A deal can stop being tracked in two very different ways, and for a long time
 * both were reported with the same sentence:
 *
 *  - **Closed.** A closing order went to the venue; the position is gone and
 *    the P&L is final.
 *  - **Cancelled while still holding volume.** No closing order was ever sent.
 *    The position stays on the exchange, unmanaged, with no take profit and no
 *    stop loss. This is the ordinary outcome of stopping a bot whose
 *    `stopType` is `leave`.
 *
 * The second case was written to the event log as `Deal closed, profit: 0$`. A
 * user who read that correctly concluded the deal was finished; it was not. A
 * 125 XRP Kraken futures short abandoned that way on 2026-08-18 went unwatched
 * for three days and was liquidated by the venue on 08-21.
 *
 * These are pure so the wording is pinned by `dealOutcome.spec.ts` — the whole
 * defect was a sentence, and a sentence is exactly the kind of thing that gets
 * "tidied" back into being wrong.

/**
 * What to do about a close request that found no deal in the worker's map.
 *
 * The dispatch path answers the caller `ok` before the engine has looked at
 * anything, so by the time we get here the user has already been told the close
 * succeeded. Two very different situations arrive at the same branch:
 *
 *  - the deal really is finished, and this is a duplicate request — the common
 *    case, and nothing worth telling anyone about;
 *  - the database still holds the deal as live, so the request was accepted,
 *    dropped, and never actioned. That is the one the user has to hear about:
 *    they will otherwise act on a position they believe is closed.
 *
 * The live set is the COMPLEMENT of `{closed, canceled}` rather than a list of
 * live statuses on purpose — it is the same predicate the dispatcher itself uses
 * to admit the request (`status: {$nin: [closed, canceled]}`), so the two cannot
 * drift apart, and a status added later is treated as live rather than silently
 * unreportable.
 *
 * Gated on the trigger because only `manual` and `api` have a caller who was
 * answered `ok`. Every other trigger is the engine calling itself, where there
 * is nobody to inform and a report would be pure noise — one deal stuck in a
 * retry loop accounts for the overwhelming majority of these warnings.
