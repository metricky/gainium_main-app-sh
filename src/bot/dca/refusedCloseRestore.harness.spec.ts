/**
 * Regression tests for spec
 * `053.a-refused-deal-close-leaves-the-position-with-nothing-on-the-book`
 * (issue #784).
 *
 * Drives the REAL `dcaHelper.closeDealById` over a minimal base class — no
 * stack, DB, Redis or exchange connection — so a broken wiring shows up as a
 * missing `placeOrders` call rather than as a stubbed assertion.
 *
 * The defect: closing a deal is a replacement, but the engine cancels first and
 * places second. `cancelAllOrder(0, dealId, true)` pulls the resting
 * take-profit, the replacement is refused for funds, and the refusal branch
 * reports and returns. The deal stays `open` holding its whole position with
 * NOTHING on the book, and since coverage is only re-established as a side
 * effect of a fill, there is no longer anything that can fill.
 *
 * Production, 2026-09-17: 420 live open deals across 14 users in exactly that
 * state, the oldest uncovered since 2026-08-14. The fixture below is the shape
 * of one of them — a filled entry, a cancelled take-profit, nothing resting.
 *
 * `createDCABotHelper` is a mixin factory, so the helper is built on a minimal
 * base class.
 *
 * Run: `npm test` (mocha).
