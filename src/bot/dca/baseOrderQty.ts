/**
 * How much base a DCA deal's BASE order contributes to the take-profit size.
 *
 * `getTPOrder` sizes the close as `sum(entry fills) + baseOrderQty`. The base
 * order is added separately because its row is the one that most often is not
 * in the order map: a base order that partially fills and is then CANCELED is a
 * terminal row that `loadOrders` used to filter out, so after a worker restart
 * `findBaseOrderByDeal` had nothing to find.
 *
 * What it fell back to was the NOMINAL size — `baseOrderSize` converted through
 * the current price. That is a guess, and it was wrong in both directions:
 *
 *  - A Coinbase AIOZ deal's base order executed 345.3 of 1790.1 before being
 *    cancelled. The nominal re-derivation put 1788.4 back, and the deal rested a
 *    take-profit for 5147.9 (1788.4 + 3366 of safety fills) against 3711.30
 *    actually held. The venue rejected it, which leaves the deal with NO
 *    take-profit at all.
 *  - Sized before the order map was populated, the same fallback produced the
 *    nominal ALONE: 1786.1 against the same 3711.30.
 *
 * The deal's own books already know the answer. `deal.size` is the volume the
 * deal entered — gross of what it has since sold, which is tracked separately
 * ({@link grossEntryVolume}) — so whatever it accounts for beyond the counted
 * safety fills IS the base order: exactly, with no reference to settings. The
 * nominal survives only for its original case: a deal that holds nothing yet
 * because its opening order has not landed.
 *
 * Pure so `baseOrderQty.spec.ts` can pin it against the real prod numbers.

 * Gross entry volume a deal is known to have taken on.
 *
 * `deal.size` is already GROSS of every partial take-profit: on B3-USDC deal
 * `6a90e161…` the base order executed 204177 and the nine safety orders 785282,
 * and `deal.size` reads 989458.9999999998 — the sum, to the unit — while the
 * 54103 the deal had already sold sits in `tpHistory` and nowhere else. That
 * holds fleet-wide: on 2026-09-08, 20 of the 21 open deals carrying a partial
 * `tpHistory` had `|deal.size|` equal to their summed entry fills exactly, and
 * `tpCoverageReconcile.trackedPosition` (spec `013`) already reads it that way.
 * So the closed quantity must NOT be added back here — `getTPOrder`'s `add`
 * term subtracts it once, downstream, and that is the only time it should be
 * counted.
 *
 * `reduceFunds` is the opposite case and is why this is not simply
 * `Math.abs(dealSize)`: an EXECUTED reduce-funds withdrawal does leave
 * `deal.size` (DOGEUSDT `size 4141` against 9073 entered and 4932 withdrawn),
 * so it has to come back to reach the entry volume. A QUEUED one has not
 * happened yet, is still in the position, and is already included — pass only
 * the executed ones.
 *
 * This used to take `getTPOrder`'s `add` and negate it, which bundled all three
 * quantities together and got two of the three wrong. Adding the take-profit
 * closes back over-stated the base order's contribution by exactly what had
 * been sold, and once spec `017` started COMPARING that against the base-order
 * row the over-statement became live for every deal with a partial take-profit:
 * `6a90e161…` rested three take-profits for 988153 against the 935356 it held,
 * and all three were cancelled. Spec `026`, issue #717.
