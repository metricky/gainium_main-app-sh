/**
 * Turning the fee a venue reported into the base/quote split a deal books.
 *
 * `deal.feePaid` and `deal.commission` have always been COMPUTED — every
 * filled order's `qty * price * storedFeeRate`, never an observation. That is
 * only ever as good as the stored rate, and a stored rate can silently stop
 * matching what the venue charges, at which point every deal that account ever
 * closed carries a cost that is simply wrong. The connectors now report the
 * fee the venue actually took; this module decides, per order, whether that
 * observation can be booked and what it means in terms of the pair.
 *
 * The rule that governs everything here:
 *
 *   **An order whose fee we cannot resolve keeps the ESTIMATE. It is never
 *   booked as zero.**
 *
 * A zero would be a claim — "this fill was free" — and a wrong one, replacing
 * a roughly-right number with a definitely-wrong one. There are three ways an
 * order fails to resolve, and all three fall back rather than zero out:
 *
 *   1. The venue reported no fee at all (paper trading before core 1.3.8, an
 *      order with no fills, Binance futures, a venue lookup that predates this
 *      change).
 *   2. The venue charged in an asset that is NEITHER side of the pair — an
 *      account paying fees in BNB, BGB or KCS. The amount is real and is kept
 *      on the order, but converting it into base or quote needs an FX rate at
 *      the fill's timestamp that we do not have here, and inventing one would
 *      be the same kind of assumption the stored rate turned out to be.
 *   3. The fee was split across several currencies (`feeBreakdown`) and not
 *      all of them are sides of the pair.

/**
 * The observed fee expressed on ONE side of the pair — the side the caller's
 * existing estimate would have used.
 *
 * The grid/combo transaction path is built on an invariant the estimate
 * happens to satisfy: for a buy the fee lives in `comBase` and `comQuote` is
 * 0, for a sell the other way round. Four separate conversions downstream
 * (`comBase = comQuote / price` and friends) and several `comQuote === 0 ? …`
 * guards all read that shape. An observed fee does NOT satisfy it — Kraken
 * charges base on a sell, Coinbase charges quote on both sides — so writing
 * the venue's split in directly would leave the opposite field at 0 and let
 * the next conversion overwrite the real fee with zero.
 *
 * Converting here keeps the magnitude, which is the thing that was wrong, and
 * leaves the shape alone. Returns `null` when there is nothing to convert, so
 * the caller falls back to its estimate rather than to a zero.

/**
 * Fold one user-stream trade's commission into an order's observed fee.

 * (`n`) and `commissionAsset` (`N`) — straight into main-app, where it was
 * discarded. It is reported PER TRADE, so a partially filled order emits
 * several reports, each carrying its own slice, and they have to be summed.
 *
 * Summing is the dangerous part, so it is made idempotent rather than merely
 * careful. Venue trade ids increase monotonically per symbol, so `feeTradeId`
 * is kept as a high-water mark and a report at or below it is ignored: a
 * duplicated or replayed event — after a stream reconnect, or a restart that
 * refills the order queue — cannot inflate the fee, while a genuinely new
 * trade always counts. A report with no trade id is ignored for the same
 * reason: without an id there is no way to tell a new trade from a repeat, and
 * over-counting a fee is worse than falling back to the estimate.
 *
 * Returns the fields to merge onto the order, or `{}` when there is nothing
 * new to add.
