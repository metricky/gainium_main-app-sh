   *
   * Coalescing cannot save this on its own, because `botMessageCoalesceKey` is
   * keyed per BOT: four sibling bots on one revoked key own four separate `once`
   * rows and each raises a first occurrence. (It could not even hold WITHIN one
   * bot until the recovery clear was removed — that clear `$unset` the live
   * row's bucket on every error→recover cycle, so the next occurrence inserted a
   * fresh `count: 1` row and read as a first occurrence, every single time.) The
   * dedupe therefore has to key on the CONDITION (the account's cooldown
   * window), which is the only key that spans sibling bots and worker processes.
   *
   * Narrow by construction: only the `AUTH_FAILURE_SIGNATURES` allowlist that

        // `botMessageTombstoneTtl` already states the rule this violated: a live
        // row is one the user has not dismissed and can still see, and age is not
        // consent to hide it. Neither is the bot's status flipping back.
        //
        // The clear was load-bearing once, for re-raisability: it was the only
        // thing that dropped a row out of `botMessageCoalesceKey`, and without
        // that a `logMode:'once'` row would stay the coalescing target forever.
        // Two things have since taken that job, which is why removing it is safe:
        // dismissal (`deleteBotMessage`) `$unset`s `bucket` itself, and the
        // re-raise backoff moved the rate limit onto the RAISE rather than the
        // row. So a repeat now does what `once` always meant it to do — `$inc`
