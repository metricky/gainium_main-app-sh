 * Arming for the two Kraken-spot bulk venue calls, spec
 * `specs/082.kraken-spot-bulk-cancel-and-bulk-place.md` §5.
 *
 * Both flags gate code that talks to a live venue with real money — one that
 * cancels many resting orders in a single request, one that places many. Neither
 * is a behaviour anyone asked for by running the engine, so deploying them must
 * not, by itself, change how a single account is traded. An operator arms them
 * deliberately, one bot first, having read what the batch path logs.
 *
 * The shape is the one `BOT_TP_COVERAGE_REPAIR` established (spec `016`): `1`
 * for the whole fleet, or a comma-separated list of bot ids for a careful
 * rollout. It is a separate parser rather than that one reused because the
 * subject is different — bot ids, which are ObjectIds *or* UUIDs, where that
 * flag names deal ids — and a validator that accepted both shapes for both
 * flags would accept a deal id typed into a bot-id flag and silently arm
 * nothing.
