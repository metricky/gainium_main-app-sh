/**
 * A latch for reporting a STANDING condition once instead of once per check.
 *
 * The bot engine re-evaluates some conditions on a loop — "can this account
 * fund a base order?" runs about once a minute per (bot, pair). When the answer
 * is no for a reason only the user can fix, nothing about that is news after the
 * first time, but every reporting path in `MainBot` is built for *events*:
 * `handleErrors` inserts a `botevents` document per call and `processError`'s
 * only repeat gate keys on `BotStatusEnum.error`, which a warning never sets. So
 * a condition that simply persists was reported forever — 8.3 M log lines and
 * 56 % of all `botevents` written in a day (spec 008 §2).
 *
 * Deduplicating on the rendered message does not work and must not be
 * attempted: those messages embed live numbers (`required`, `price`) that drift
 * every cycle while the condition itself is unchanged. The key has to name the
 * condition — a stable reason plus the pair it holds for.
 *
 * Deliberately in-memory, unlike {@link RetryBackoff}, which is Redis-backed
 * because it gates whether an ORDER reaches a venue and so must hold across
 * workers. This gates only whether a REPORT is written, and a bot lives in one
 * worker at a time, so a per-instance map is already per-(bot, condition). A
 * worker restart re-arms it and re-reports once, which is correct: the restarted
 * worker has no record that the user was ever told.
