/**
 * A user-stream execution report that is older than the row it would overwrite.
 *
 * Spec `090`. The stream delivers one report per state change of an order, and
 * an order's state only moves forward: the venue acknowledges it (`NEW`), then
 * executes it (`PARTIALLY_FILLED`), then ends it. The delivery order is not
 * guaranteed — production has a `NEW` arriving 10 ms AFTER the
 * `PARTIALLY_FILLED` it precedes, carrying the venue's own earlier timestamp —
 * and `convertExecutionReportToOrder` merges whatever it is handed onto the row
 * it holds. The acknowledgement therefore rewound a part-filled base entry to
 * `status: 'NEW', executedQty: '0'`, which is the state every guard written for
 * a part-filled entry then read: `shouldSettlePartialBaseEntry` (specs `038` /
 * `048`) declines a `NEW` row, and `checkBaseOrder` falls through to the arm
 * that cancels the entry and places a second base order on top of a position
 * the account is already holding.
 *
 * This is the temporal half of a rule the bot already states twice:
 * `fillEvidence.ts` — what the venue did not state cannot overwrite what we
 * know — and `settledBaseEntryFill` (spec `059`) — an order's executed quantity
 * never decreases, so a report of less than we already read is an absence of
 * information, not a correction.
 *
 * Pure: no venue, no DB, no bot.

 *    same order time, and those must keep landing exactly as they do today.

 *    venue never un-fills an order back to `NEW`, so this shape is stale by
 *    construction and there is no legitimate reading of it.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT included: a report that merely states a smaller
 * `executedQty`. The same monotonicity argument applies to it, but so does
 * spec `088` — after a settle tops a base entry back up, the venue's own cancel
 * report legitimately states LESS than the merged row holds, and `088` routes
 * exactly that report through `fillPartiallyFilledOrder`'s post-mutex re-read.
 * Widening this predicate to quantity would take that report away from it.
