/**
 * Policy for exchange API keys that carry withdrawal permission.
 *
 * The connector reports facts (`KeyPermissions`); this module decides what to
 * do about them. The split matters because only main-app knows whether a
 * connection is brand new or already live and trading.
 *
 * Background: Gainium needs read + trade and nothing else. Withdrawal is never
 * required by any feature, but nothing used to verify that a stored key was
 * actually limited that way, so it was an assumption rather than a property.
 *
 * THE RULE
 * --------
 *   New credentials  → hard reject. The user is at the form, can read why, and
 *                      nothing of theirs is running yet.
 *   Existing         → record and flag only. NEVER reject.
 *
 * That asymmetry is the whole safety argument for shipping this. Rejecting on
 * re-verification would take a user whose keys work today, fail their
 * connection, and stop their live bots — punishing them for a rule that did
 * not exist when they connected. Every re-verify path must therefore call
 * `recordOnly`, and only the add/replace-credentials paths may call
 * `shouldRejectNewConnection`.

 * user's sub-accounts into their master account, and while the funds stay
 * inside the user's own tree, anyone holding the key can move them.
 *
 * Gainium calls no transfer endpoint on any exchange, so this permission buys
