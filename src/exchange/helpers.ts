/**
 * Correct the Coinbase key type when the submitted credentials plainly

 *
 * Coinbase's two "key types" are two AUTH SCHEMES for the same account, not
 * two products: the connector uses `keysType` only to choose between
 * `{apiKey, apiSecret}` and `{cloudApiKeyName, cloudApiSecret}` when building
 * its client. Picking the right one changes nothing about what the user can
 * trade — which is why correcting it silently is safe here, and why the
 * equivalent move for `okxSource` is NOT (that one selects a venue with a
 * different tradable universe, so it is only ever reported, never adopted).
 *
 * The selector lives behind an "Advanced Settings" disclosure that defaults to
 * Legacy, and getting it wrong produced the single largest verification-failure
 * bucket in prod — with, until now, no diagnostic at all attached to it.
 *
 * Correction is one-directional and evidence-led. A Coinbase Developer Platform
 * key is self-identifying: the key NAME is a resource path and the secret is a
 * PEM private key, and cloud auth cannot work without them. Their absence is
 * NOT equally strong evidence of a legacy key — a truncated paste looks the
 * same — so `cloud` is never downgraded here. That direction is handled by the
 * failure message instead, which can say what it suspects without acting on it.
