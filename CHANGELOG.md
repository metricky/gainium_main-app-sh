# Changelog

## [1.80.1] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- Stopping or deleting a bot while the exchange refuses its cancel requests for rate now re-sends each refused cancel after a back-off, so the order is recorded as cancelled (or reconciled with the exchange) instead of staying open in the bot's records after the bot's order stream has closed.

## [1.80.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- Indicator condition `bw` ("between") for value-type indicators (RSI, CCI, MFI, Williams %R, ADX, AO, UO, MOM, VO, BBW, BBWP, %B, Keltner %B, MA ratio, ATR, ADR, ATH): the condition holds while the value is strictly between `indicatorValue` and the new `indicatorValue2` — one indicator instead of a "greater than" + "lower than" pair. Live bots and backtests (`@gainium/backtester` 1.11.0) evaluate it the same way. The v2 API accepts it only on those indicators, with two numeric bounds and without percentile; price, profit and uPnL conditions keep their single-value set.

## [1.79.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- `restartDeal` covers hedge DCA and hedge Combo deals. The request is routed to the bot that owns the deal (a hedge bot's long or short side), read from the deal itself, so it works whichever bot id the client sends.

## [1.78.1] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- `getBotWindowStats` win rate is now wins / (wins + losses), as the bot statistics count it; a break-even deal is neither.

## [1.78.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- `restartDeal` (GraphQL): restart a single DCA or Combo deal. Its open safety orders and take profit are cancelled and placed again from the deal's current state — the same rebuild a deal settings save runs — without reloading the bot or touching its other deals. Useful when an order was refused (for example for lack of balance) and the funds are now there.

## [1.77.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- `getBotWindowStats` (GraphQL): a DCA / Combo bot's performance over its whole life and since its stats were last reset, derived from its deals. Lifetime figures survive a sizing or profit-currency change; money is USD and return / drawdown are measured against the peak capital the bot had committed at once. A deal opened before a reset and closed after it counts in the "since" window.

### Changed

- Changing a bot's max active deals no longer resets its statistics. It changes how many deals run at once, not the size of any one deal.

## [1.76.3] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- Deal lists: `isNoneOf` and `notContains` on `botName` and `pair`. A bot-name negation excludes the matching bots' deals by bot id.
- Generic list filters (bot lists, global variables, …): `isNoneOf` and `notContains`.

### Fixed

- Generic list filters compared text operators against the URI-encoded value, so `contains` / `equals` / `startsWith` / `endsWith` never matched a value holding a space or another encoded character, and `isAnyOf` decoded only the first space of each listed value. Values are now decoded before matching.

## [1.76.2] - 2026-10-06

### Fixed

- DCA LIMIT entry reposition: when the cancel of a resting base order raced a partial fill on a venue that cancels asynchronously, the bot re-placed the base order instead of opening the deal on the fill. When the fill was later picked up, the rest of the base order was not put back on the book on contract-sized and coin-margined accounts. The reposition cancel now waits for the venue to end the order and books it through the same settle as a stranded partial entry. A cancelled order that was still listed live no longer stays `NEW` in the orders collection.

## [1.76.1] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- Change trail: the action `restart_bot` (a bot reload request).

## [1.76.0] - 2026-10-06

### Added

- Change trail: actor type `telegram` (the owner acting from a linked Telegram chat) and the actions `start_bot` / `stop_bot`.

## [1.75.3] - 2026-10-05

### Fixed

- Deal Returns chart: the series returned only the newest 500 closed deals, so on a bot with more closed deals the older part of the chart, which shares its time axis with the Performance chart, was empty. It now returns every closed deal.

## [1.75.2] - 2026-10-05

### Fixed

- RabbitMQ client: a dropped connection is recovered once (on `close`) instead of twice (on `error` and `close`); its channels are forgotten instead of closed again, which logged an `IllegalOperationError: Channel closed` line per channel; the dead connection is no longer handed out until the delayed reconnect, so the next caller connects afresh; and a connection that drops while its channels are opening, or a reply consumer started on a channel that just closed, no longer raises an unhandled rejection (fatal in a worker thread).

## [1.75.1] - 2026-10-05

### Fixed

- GraphQL `dealSizes` exposes `multiplier` and `multiplierScope`, so DCA and Combo deal queries can read the size a deal was scaled to (stored since 1.75.0).

## [1.75.0] - 2026-10-05

### Added

- New-deal approval hooks can ask for a different deal size: an approving `approveNewDeal` may set `sizeMultiplier` (0.1–3) and `sizeScope` (`base` = the base order only, `whole` = the base order and every DCA order). The engine scales the deal on top of compound / risk-reduction sizes, then checks the balance and the exchange minimums again at the scaled size; anything that does not hold opens the deal at the configured size, with the reason in a `Deal` event. Base, quote and USD order sizes, DCA and Combo; not for terminal deals, hedge legs, risk/reward sizing or % of balance sizes. The deal stores `sizes.multiplier` / `sizes.multiplierScope`; `onNewDealSize` reports the outcome to a deployment.
- A refusing hook may set `retryOpen` with `retryAfterMs` to re-attempt the entry later for any start condition (not only ASAP), with every engine gate run again.
- Combo `getBaseOrder` / `createInitialDealOrders` fill the minimum-order collectors like DCA, so a Combo deal can be scaled.
- Change trail action `open_deal`.

## [1.74.4] - 2026-10-05

### Fixed

- Ignore Exchange Fees: turning the switch on or off for a connection only reached bots started after the change; bots already running kept the old setting until they were restarted, so they kept leaving fee dust on new deals. Running bots on that connection now pick the change up immediately, in both directions. A deal that re-places its closing order after the change also uses the new setting, as it already did after a restart.

## [1.74.3] - 2026-10-04

### Fixed

- Combo with Smart Grids: grid orders the bot cancelled itself to keep only the nearest levels on the book were also removed from their mini grid's ladder, so they were never placed again when the price came back, and a deal could hold a position with no sell order until its settings were saved. Orders the bot cancels itself now stay on the ladder; an order cancelled by the exchange or the account owner is still removed and its funds released.

## [1.74.2] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- DCA: an open deal whose average entry price was written before 1.74.1 left out a base order that filled only partly and then ended cancelled, so its take profit was priced from the lower safety-order average and its size over-stated the position until the next safety order filled. The bot now recomputes that average, the deal size and the planned take profit when it restores the deal. The restore itself places and cancels no order; the corrected take profit is used the next time the bot places one.

## [1.74.1] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- DCA/Combo: when a base order filled only partly and the bot cancelled the rest, the base order could be stored as cancelled and was then left out of the deal's average entry price. The deal then over-stated how many coins it held, so its take profit asked for more than the deal bought — rejected by the exchange for insufficient balance, or selling coins the user held outside the deal — and was priced off the lower average. The settled base order is now stored as filled, the average counts a cancelled base order's fills, and a take profit is never sized above what the deal's own balance records.

## [1.74.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- Backtests: a stored DCA or Combo backtest result can carry an optional `source` (`kind`, `id`, `variant`, `status`, `progress`) naming the process that produced it, so a runner that stores its results next to the user's backtests can create the row when it starts and report its status and progress there. Plain backtests leave it unset.

### Fixed

- Backtest lists (DCA, Combo, Grid, Hedge): a request sorted descending was sorted ascending, so asking for the newest backtests first returned the oldest page, and anyone with more stored backtests than one page did not see their latest ones. The requested direction is now honoured, with ties broken consistently so pages neither repeat nor skip rows. A sort on `created` keeps its previous direction for the clients that rely on it. Other lists are unchanged.

## [1.73.2] - 2026-10-03

### Fixed

- Grid bots: a futures grid whose take profit or stop loss ("stop and sell") fired while its position was already closed cancelled every grid order but never stopped, leaving the bot running with no orders. It now stops.

## [1.73.1] - 2026-10-03

### Changed

- API docs: the v1 swagger and the AI API guide describe replacing a bot's indicators on update/clone, including safety-order indicators.

## [1.73.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added

- REST API: updating or cloning a DCA or Combo bot (v2 `PUT /api/v2/bots/{dca|combo}/{botId}` and `/clone`, and the v1 update/clone calls) now accepts `indicators` and `indicatorGroups`, including safety-order indicators and their `minPercFromLast`. Each list replaces the bot's current one; send an indicator back with its `uuid` to keep it. Items are checked with the same rules as bot creation and against the bot's other settings, and an indicator read back from the API can be sent again unchanged. A bot update can also switch `startCondition` to `TechnicalIndicators` and `dcaCondition` to `indicators`, as long as the bot has the matching indicator.

### Fixed

- REST API: the `LW` indicator's documented `lwCondition` field was rejected as unexpected when creating a bot.

## [1.72.2] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- DCA bots: when a base order stopped part-filled and the bot cancelled the rest on an exchange that cancels asynchronously, the cancel answer still showed the order open and the deal was left waiting with no take profit or safety orders. The bot now waits for the exchange to finish the cancel and opens the deal on what was bought; the exchange's own cancel report and a bot restart can now also open such a deal.

## [1.72.1] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed

- Grid bots: on a neutral futures grid, the run-up, drawdown and live value statistics valued the open position against the average of every fill, while the percentage take-profit and stop-loss value it against the fills the close actually books. They now use the same entry, so a run-up above the take-profit no longer appears while the take-profit has correctly not fired. The bot exposes that entry as `closeEntry` (an additive field) for the dashboards. When and how the take-profit and stop-loss fire is unchanged.

## [1.72.0] - 2026-10-02

### Changed

- Backtest engine 1.8.0: optional synchronous hooks and per-deal settings a server-side backtest runner can use; without hooks every backtest runs exactly as before.

## [1.71.0] - 2026-10-02

### Added

- Bot engine: a last-step approval hook for signal-based take-profit closes (a close-deal indicator group, or a webhook close signal with the take-profit close condition set to webhook), asked per deal after the minimum-profit check. The default always approves, synchronously, so bots without an extension wait for nothing new. Several deals closing on one signal are asked together. A refusal keeps the deal open and is recorded on the bot's events with its reason; a failing extension closes as usual. Stop loss, manual and API closes, force closes, liquidation and take profit by orders never ask it.

## [1.70.4] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- DCA: a deal closed by a signal could be bought back (or sold) twice. If a safety order with a partial fill was cancelled while the close was running, the rebuilt ladder could still place a new take-profit after the closing order had already filled. Orders are no longer placed once the deal is closed or its take-profit has filled, and any safety orders still resting are cancelled.

## [1.70.3] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- Dashboard USD valuation (the "In positions" figure and balances with USD values) no longer waits on the exchange's price list when the venue's read limit is used up. It answers from the last good price list and refreshes it in the background; it waits on a live fetch only when no price list has been stored yet. Bot price reads are unchanged.

## [1.70.2] - 2026-10-01

### Changed

- The broker code is now also sent on batch order placement (`orders/openBatch`), not only on single orders.

## [1.70.1] - 2026-10-01

### Security

- Log lines are scrubbed of bearer bot tokens before they are written. HTTP clients quote the request URL in their errors, and some messaging APIs carry the token in that URL; this now applies to every log line, including whole error objects and their nested causes.

## [1.70.0] - 2026-09-30

### Added

- Change trail: every change to a bot's or a deal's settings, a deal close, a reset and an add/reduce funds request is recorded with who made it (user, API, webhook or system) and the values before and after. Readable per bot or per deal through the new `changeTrail` query. Entries are kept for one year.
- Change trail: the settings entry points accept an optional per-call override of the recorded action and reason, so a change that restores earlier values is recorded as a `revert`.
- Bot engine: a last-step approval hook for new deals, asked after all of a bot's own start checks have passed and before the deal is created. The default always approves; a refusal is recorded on the bot's events with its reason. Manual deal starts never ask it.

## [1.69.20] - 2026-10-01

### Removed

- An unused bot visibility setting left over from the previous dashboard. Nothing you see changes.

## [1.69.19] - 2026-10-01

### Changed

- Bots viewed by anyone other than their owner, through a share link or the demo, no longer include owner-only settings. The bot, its settings and its deals display as before.

## [1.69.18] - 2026-10-01

### Fixed

- When an added-funds order filled at the same moment as a safety order, the deal could keep the coins the addition bought but leave out what was paid for them. The deal's cost, average price and unrealized P&L then looked better than they were. This could happen to the rest of a part-filled limit base order, which is placed as an added-funds order. Both fills now count in full. The orders a deal places are unchanged.

## [1.69.17] - 2026-09-30

### Fixed

- When the trading engine restarted, a waiting limit order placed from the Trading Terminal was cancelled and placed again at the same price, so it lost its place in the exchange queue. The order is now left on the exchange if it is still waiting at your price. Limit entries of regular DCA bots are repositioned as before.

## [1.69.16] - 2026-09-30

### Fixed

- A limit order placed from the Trading Terminal was cancelled automatically about a day after it was placed if it had not filled yet. Terminal limit orders now stay open until they fill or are cancelled. Other deals whose first order has not filled within a day are still cancelled automatically, as before.

## [1.69.15] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- Closing a Combo deal could make the bot place new grid buys and sells for that deal while the close was in progress. When the close cancels a grid order that was already partly filled, that fill is now recorded as before, but no grid orders are placed for the deal until the close finishes or is abandoned. Before, such a buy could land above the market and fill straight away, adding to the position being sold, and a sell could be refused for lack of balance because the close already held that base.

## [1.69.14] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- A DCA bot whose deals opened at the same moment (for example a multi-pair bot on a timer) could show one open deal and one total deal fewer than it had. The two count updates could reach the database out of order, keeping the older value; they are now written one after the other.

## [1.69.13] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed

- Saving a multi-pair bot while some of its pairs were momentarily missing from the pair list could drop those pairs' metadata, or empty it entirely, leaving the bot unable to display. A save now keeps the metadata the bot already had for those pairs and never stores an empty set. The hourly exchange pair refresh also no longer removes OKX Europe pairs (EU spot and X-Perps), which the global instrument list does not include.

## [1.69.12] - 2026-09-28

### Fixed

- "Change DCA levels" on a deal whose safety orders are triggered by indicators or a custom list saved the new value but left the ladder unchanged, so the deal kept placing every level. The action now limits that deal's ladder to the chosen number of levels (up to one per indicator or custom row); deals it is not used on are unchanged. Raising the value again restores the remaining levels as the bot defines them, and resetting the deal to the bot settings removes the limit.

## [1.69.11] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

- A neutral futures grid's value-changed take-profit and stop-loss valued the open position against the whole-position average entry, while the close is booked against the entry of the fills not yet paired into round trips; the check now uses the same entry as the close, so a take-profit no longer fires before the bot reaches its target and a stop-loss no longer fires past it.

## [1.69.10] - 2026-09-27

### Changed

- API docs and indicator definitions now state how a Moving Average rule reads: `<maType> <indicatorCondition> <maCrossingValue>`, i.e. the moving average compared to the reference. Price above EMA 100 is `maType: ema, indicatorLength: 100, indicatorCondition: lt, maCrossingValue: price`. The MA definition example now includes `maCrossingValue` and uses the lowercase `ema` enum value. No change to how rules are stored or evaluated.

## [1.69.9] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

- Public API balances (`/api/balances`, `/api/v2/user/balances`) filtered by a futures connection that shares its wallet with a spot connection returned nothing; they now read the shared wallet and report it under the requested connection, as the dashboard does.

## [1.69.8] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

- Hyperliquid legs of one wallet were only linked when they held the same API agent; they are now matched on the wallet address (case-insensitive), which is what identifies the account.

## [1.69.7] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

- Hyperliquid unified / portfolio-margin and Bitget Unified Trading Account wallets were counted once per connected market leg in the portfolio. Legs that share one wallet are now linked to their spot leg (re-checked hourly, so switching account mode heals itself), the wallet is stored once, and summed balances and daily snapshots skip linked legs.

## [1.69.6] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- **Changing a global variable no longer wipes the statistics of every DCA and Combo bot that uses it.** A variable change that does not restart the bot reset the bot's statistics whenever the bot had any, whatever the variable controlled — so a variable used as a price filter or a condition value cleared the Statistics tab of every bot bound to it. Only a variable bound to an order-sizing field (order size, base order size, number of orders, volume scale, max open deals) resets them now, the same rule as editing those fields in the bot settings, and the bot's equity chart is kept as it is there. The reset also now reaches the running bot, which previously wrote its old statistics back on the next deal close.

## [1.69.5] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- **Moving a grid bot's range no longer fires a false take profit or places every level on one side.** After a range edit, the restarted bot anchored its new orders on the last order the old grid had filled and rebuilt its starting balances at the price the bot first started at. When the new range lay entirely away from those prices, every level became a sell (some below the market, refused for lack of balance), and the value-change take profit or stop loss compared the bot against a baseline that credited it with the whole price move at once, so an 8 % take profit could fire straight after saving. A last fill outside the new grid is no longer used as the anchor — orders are placed from the latest price — and when the new range no longer contains the start price, the start price is reset to the current price.

## [1.69.4] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- **No more "Close order is below the exchange minimum ... qty 0" warning on a deal that is working normally.** For a few seconds at a time a deal can hold nothing the bot could close: while a part-filled base order is cancelled and its remainder placed again, just after an entry fills and before the deal's size catches up, and as the take profit fills and the deal closes. The close check treated that moment as a close the exchange would never accept and warned the user, although the take profit was placed or the deal closed moments later. A zero holding within five minutes of the deal's last order change is now only logged. A deal that stays at zero for longer is still reported, and real dust below the minimum is reported as before.

## [1.69.3] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- **A market buy on Bitget spot now fills the full quantity the bot asked for, and its top-up is no longer refused as size zero.** Bitget sizes a spot market buy in the quote coin and fills that amount divided by the ask, rounded down to the pair's quantity step. The bot funded the order at the last trade price, so whenever the ask was above the last trade the order came back one step short, and the one-step top-up that should cover the gap was converted to zero and refused. The amount is now funded for the quantity plus half a step, so the round-down lands on the requested quantity across a normal spread without buying more at the price the order was sized at.

## [1.69.2] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- **A daily time-based trigger set to a past date no longer opens a deal straight away, and no longer runs a day early or late outside UTC.** The bot keeps only the calendar date of the next run and opens it at the chosen time in the user's timezone. When the stored date was in the past, the bot moved the next run to the correct time, but it stored that time's own date. East of UTC that date is the previous day, so the run stayed in the past and a deal opened immediately. West of UTC the date could be a day later, so a day was skipped. The bot now stores the date of the next run as it falls in the user's timezone. The settings-change event also shows that date (`YYYY-MM-DD`, or the UTC time for hourly triggers) instead of a raw timestamp.

## [1.69.1] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- **A DCA deal that closes on its take profit while safety orders are still filling now sells all of them, not just the first.** When a price move fills the take profit and several safety orders at almost the same moment, the deal closes on the take profit and each safety-order fill that arrives afterwards is sold back at market. Only the first of those late fills was sold: the sale marked the deal as "remainder sold", and every later fill was skipped because of that mark, so its coin stayed in the account outside any deal. Each late safety-order fill is now sold once, on its own.

## [1.69.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- **A LIMIT base order that only partly fills no longer drops the rest, on DCA bots that never enter at market.** A bot whose deals start with a LIMIT order and whose "Enter Market Timeout" is off still opens the deal on what filled, so its take profit and stop loss cover that part straight away. The unfilled rest now stays on the exchange as a LIMIT order and joins the deal's position when it fills, moving the average price and the take profit with it. If the price moves away, the rest is cancelled and placed again at the new price. At an unchanged price it is left alone. The bot still never buys at market on its own.
- **Buy the rest of a part-filled base order at market, on request.** The new `buyDealBaseRemainder` mutation cancels the resting rest, books whatever it had filled, and buys what is still missing with a market order that joins the deal's position. Pending add-funds entries now expose `baseRemainder` and `baseTotal`, so a dashboard can show a deal's resting remainder as "filled of total".

## [1.68.4] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- **Saving a DCA bot or reloading it no longer places a second copy of a pending add-funds or reduce-funds limit order.** A reload re-sent every pending addition and reduction, including the ones whose order was still waiting on the exchange, so each got a twin and both could fill — the deal bought (or sold) that amount twice. Only an entry whose order is gone (cancelled, or never placed) is sent again now; a waiting order is left as it is.

## [1.68.3] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- **DCA bots created before the exchange-minimum default could refuse deals although "Allow increasing orders to exchange minimum" was on.** A restarted bot restores its settings from a cached snapshot, and a snapshot written before the setting existed did not carry it, so the bot treated it as off. The bot now reads the setting from its saved configuration when the cached copy does not have it.
- **The exchange-minimum notification now shows the pair it is about.** Refusals on different pairs of one bot shared a single notification whose pair tag stayed on the first pair refused while the text named the latest. Each pair now gets its own notification.

## [1.68.2] - 2026-09-25

### Changed

- **Per-pair statistics report peak capital, not the largest single deal.** `getBotPairStats` replaces `maxDealCapitalUsd` with `peakCapitalUsd`: the most capital the pair had committed at once, summed over its deals open at the same time (a deal closing as another opens re-uses the same capital). A bot running several deals per pair ties up their sum, so return on capital measured against one deal overstated it many times over.

## [1.68.1] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- **An order that never reached the exchange no longer stays "open" forever.** When a placement was refused but its outcome looked uncertain, the bot kept the order as open and left it for the reconcile check to settle. On KuCoin that never happened: KuCoin's answer for a missing order was not recognised as "not found", so the order was asked about again on every check. Where an exchange's answer was recognised, the order was only set aside, still counted as resting, so a take-profit that was never placed could look like a live exit. Now an order that never received an exchange order id, is more than a day old, and that the exchange confirms does not exist is marked cancelled and dropped. An order placed seconds ago is never judged on that answer.

## [1.68.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- **Per-pair statistics from the deals.** A new `getBotPairStats` query returns one row per pair of a DCA, Combo or hedge bot, folded from the bot's deals when asked: closed deals, wins and losses, realized profit, gross profit and loss, profit factor, fees (in the pair's quote asset), the largest capital a single deal used, average and longest deal duration, the deepest intra-deal drawdown, and the open deals with their current P&L and capital. An optional `from` / `to` window filters the closed deals by close time; open deals are always included. Pairs the bot is configured for but has never traded get a zero row. Access follows the bot: its owner, or a visitor holding the share link of a shared bot.

### Fixed

- **Profit factor is now gross profit divided by gross loss.** Live bot statistics stored the number of winning deals divided by the number of losing deals under this name, both for the bot and for each pair, which could read well above 1 for a bot losing money. It is now computed from money, the same way backtests compute it. The bot-wide value is corrected on the bot's next closed deal from totals it already kept. Each pair now also keeps its gross profit and loss; a pair recorded before this version seeds both once from its earlier deals on its next close, so its factor covers its whole history rather than only the deals that follow. The AI bot details recompute the bot-wide factor from the stored totals and omit a pair's factor until it has been seeded.

## [1.67.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- **Stop a bot after X consecutive winning or losing deals.** Two new Bot Controller limits sit alongside the existing total win and total loss counts, and count a run rather than a total: the bot stops only when its most recently closed deals are that many wins, or that many losses, with nothing of the other kind in between. One opposite result clears the run and counting starts again. Deals are counted in the order they actually closed, so a bot trading several pairs is not misread because its deals finish interleaved, and a deal that closes at exactly breakeven counts as a loss — the same split the existing counts use. Both limits are off by default and change nothing for existing bots.

## [1.66.4] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- **A restart no longer places a second copy of an order placed just before it.** On a service restart a DCA or Combo bot restores its orders from a Redis snapshot that is written on a delay, so orders placed in the last moments before the restart could be missing from it. The restart order check then found no order at that safety level and no take-profit, and placed both again next to the ones already resting. The restored snapshot now takes in the deals' open orders from the database before the check runs; when both hold the same order, the more advanced status is kept. If that read fails, the snapshot is used as before.

## [1.66.3] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- **A reload never rests more safety orders than the deal's ladder holds.** Whatever the restart order check decides about which rebuilt levels are already resting, it no longer places a safety order that would leave more orders resting on a side than the ladder has levels there. Candidates beyond that are refused, starting with those priced closest to an order already resting, and the refusal is logged on the bot. This closes the cases the level pairing could not cover: a DCA deal whose ladder moved and is also missing an order, and a Combo order without a recorded level.

## [1.66.2] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed

- **Reloading a Combo bot no longer puts a second safety order next to one already resting.** After a settings save, or a restart that reloads a deal from the database, the restart order check compared the deal's rebuilt safety ladder with the resting orders by exact price. A level priced one tick differently from its resting order, for example because the ladder rounding changed since the deal opened, was placed again, and the resting order was never cancelled. The check now pairs a rebuilt level with the resting order at the same level and keeps that order. A level with nothing resting is still placed.
- **Reloading a DCA bot no longer puts a second safety order next to one already resting.** After a settings save, or a restart that reloads a deal from the database, the restart order check compared the deal's rebuilt safety ladder with the resting orders by exact price. A level priced one tick differently from its resting order, for example because the ladder rounding changed since the deal opened, was placed again, and the resting order was never cancelled. DCA orders carry no ladder level, so the check now pairs the unmatched rebuilt levels with the unmatched resting orders of the same side by rank, and keeps the resting orders when the two counts match. When they differ, a level is really missing and is placed as before.

## [1.66.1] - 2026-09-24

### Changed

- **The available balance goes to one deal, not several.** With `reduceToAvailableBalance`, the first deal that hits the shortfall opens with the available balance; while it is open, other pairs (or further deals) that hit the shortfall are skipped instead of each opening on what is left, and the not-enough-balance message says the balance is already in use. Pairs that reach the shortfall at the same moment cannot both take it. The reduced deal is marked (`sizes.reducedToAvailable`) so this holds across restarts.

## [1.66.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- **Use available balance when insufficient (DCA).** A new DCA bot setting, `reduceToAvailableBalance`. When the free balance cannot fund the whole deal (base order plus every safety order), the bot opens the deal scaled down to what is available instead of skipping it: the base order and each safety order shrink by the same ratio, so the ladder keeps its shape, and the reduction is stored on the deal for its whole life. An optional floor, `reduceToAvailableMinSize` (in the base order size's unit), skips the deal when the reduced base order would be smaller. The bot records a deal event with the percentage it opened at. Applies to regular DCA bots with a fixed order size (base, quote or USD); off by default, and has no effect with Skip Balance Check on. Exposed on GraphQL and the v2 REST API.

### Fixed

- **A take-profit re-derived from the nominal base order keeps a deal's size adjustment.** When a deal's base order row is not in memory, the take-profit falls back to the configured base order size; it now adds the deal's per-deal size delta (compound/risk reduction, and the new reduced deals), so it is not sized for more than the deal bought.

## [1.65.1] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- **A bot says when its order is waiting for liquidity.** When the exchange accepts an order but reports that nobody is on the other side of the book — Bitget Reality stock tokens outside the hours their market makers quote — the bot shows a warning explaining that the order will wait. The order is placed as before; nothing is refused.

## [1.65.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- **Pooled collateral covers USDC-quoted contracts.** A futures account whose venue reports pooled collateral (Kraken flex, Bitget Unified multi_assets, and now OKX Multi-currency / Portfolio margin) margins a USDC-quoted contract from every coin it holds, counting USDC at par with the USD pool. The deal-start, swap and not-enough-balance checks previously consulted the pool only for a USD quote, so an OKX Europe account funded in EUR read 0 USDC and could not open an X-Perp deal without skipping the balance check.
- **Percent-of-balance order sizes count pooled collateral.** DCA and Combo base orders sized as a percentage of free or total balance now size from the pool when it is larger than the quote-asset balance, instead of failing with "asset not found in user balances" on an account that holds none of the quote asset.

## [1.64.6] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- **A deleted Bitget API key is recognised as a dead key.** Bitget answers a deleted key with "apikey does not exist" and a key whose passphrase does not match with "apikey/password is incorrect"; neither was on the list of dead-credential answers, so bots on such a key re-asked the exchange on every cycle and the hourly fee refresh kept polling it. Both now open the per-account cooldown and count toward pausing the fee refresh, as the other exchanges' dead-key answers already do. Bitget's IP allow-list refusal is deliberately not treated as a dead key, since the same key can succeed on the next call.

## [1.64.5] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- **Pair names no longer disappear when the pairs sync rewrites a pair.** The sync replaced a changed pair's base-asset block with the exchange connection's copy, which carries no display name, so every rewrite erased the name until the naming job ran again. A pair's existing display name is now kept.

## [1.64.4] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- **Combo bot safety orders now land where the step percentage puts them on pairs with a coarse price tick.** The combo ladder had the same defect the DCA ladder had: each level was rounded to the tick and the next level was measured from that rounded price, so on a price near 0.25 with a 0.001 tick a 30 × 1% ladder ended 24% to 36% from the start instead of 30%. Each level is now worked out from the unrounded distance to the start and only that level is rounded, so every safety order sits within one tick of its configured percentage. Each level's mini-grid keeps its width and starts from its own level.

## [1.64.3] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- **Isolated-margin inverse bots also fund from pooled collateral.** The previous release widened the funds check for inverse (coin-margined) futures on pooled-collateral accounts only for cross margin; isolated bots still required the contract's own coin. They now use the pooled margin too, and the exchange decides whether it funds the position.

## [1.64.2] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- **A DCA start order at a limit price is no longer cancelled and re-placed at the same price every 10 seconds.** With auto-adjust on and "Enter Market Timeout" off, an unfilled start order used to be cancelled and sent again at the latest price every 10 seconds, even when that price had not changed. On a quiet pair this went on for hours, used up exchange request limits and sent the order to the back of the queue each time. The order now stays on the book while its price would not change, and moves only when the price does.
- **A DCA start order at a limit price that fills partway now opens the deal.** With "Enter Market Timeout" off, a start order that filled partly was never checked again. The deal stayed in its starting state, the bought coins were not shown, and no safety orders or take-profit were placed until the bot service restarted. The next auto-adjust check now cancels the rest of the order and opens the deal on what filled. A bot with "Enter Market Timeout" off still never buys the missing part at market.

## [1.64.1] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- **DCA safety orders now land where the step percentage puts them on pairs with a coarse price tick.** Each safety-order price was rounded to the tick and the next level was then measured from that rounded price, so every level's rounding carried into all the levels after it. On a pair whose price step is large relative to the price — a price near 0.25 with a 0.001 tick — a 30 × 1% ladder placed its last order anywhere from 24% to 36% below the start, depending on the start price, instead of 30%. Each level is now worked out from the unrounded distance to the start and only that level is rounded, so every safety order sits within one tick of its configured percentage. Step scale is applied the same way. Ladders built from indicators, custom steps or ATR/ADR scaling are unchanged. Deals already open keep the orders they have; the new prices apply to ladders built after the update.

## [1.64.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- **Pairs carry the ticker of the stock a tokenized stock tracks (`underlying`).** It comes from the exchange connection where the exchange itself marks a market as a wrapper (Bitget Reality tokens: `rAAPL` → `AAPL`, `rT` → `T`), and otherwise from a short hand-checked list for Bitget stock perpetuals whose name carries a `STOCK` suffix (`CVXSTOCK` → `CVX`). It is stored on the pair, mirrored to paper twins and returned by `getAllPairs`. Stock logos and names use it before any rule based on the symbol's shape.

### Fixed

- **Bitget stock perpetuals whose ticker starts with R showed another company's logo.** Stock-logo lookup removed a leading R from every Bitget stock, treating it as a Reality-token prefix, so a clean perpetual such as `RDDT` or `RKLB` was looked up as `DDT` or `KLB`. The R-prefix rule is gone; Bitget tickers now come only from `underlying` or the plain base name. One-letter Reality tokens such as `rT`, which the old rule did not match, now resolve too.

## [1.63.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- **Inverse (coin-margined) futures can be funded from pooled collateral.** On an account that margins every contract from its whole wallet — a Bitget Unified Trading Account in multi-assets mode — an inverse contract does not need to be funded in its own coin, but DCA, Combo and Grid bots still refused to open when that coin's balance was short. When the coin balance does not cover a deal, the bot now asks the exchange connection for its pooled margin, converts it to the coin at the deal price and uses it if it covers the order. Bots on isolated margin, and every account that does not pool its collateral, keep the per-coin check. Grid bots on pooled USD-margined accounts gain the same fallback DCA and Combo bots already had. A new `getPooledMarginAvailable` query lets the dashboard make the same check before a trading-terminal order is sent.

## [1.62.4] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- **A balance refresh the exchange refuses is now logged.** When the exchange answered a balance request with an error rather than failing outright — for example because the API key lacks a read permission the account type requires — nothing was stored and nothing was logged, so the connection showed no balances with no record of why. The refusal is now logged with the connection and the exchange's reason. Repeats are coalesced: each connection is logged at most once an hour per reason, and when many connections on one exchange fail with the same reason (the exchange itself being unavailable) only the first few are logged individually and the rest are reported as a single hourly count.

## [1.62.3] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- **OKX USDT-margined futures orders now record the right filled value.** OKX sizes these orders in contracts, and a contract can be a fraction of a coin or many coins (0.001 gold, 1,000,000 SHIB). The order's filled quantity was already converted from contracts to coins, but its filled value was stored per contract, so it was too large on symbols with a contract smaller than one coin (a thousand times on gold) and too small on symbols with a larger one. The filled value is now converted the same way as the quantity, whether the fill arrives with the order response, from the live order stream, or from an order status check. The quantity, price and deal accounting are unchanged. Orders recorded before this release keep their stored value.

## [1.62.2] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed

- **A Combo deal whose entry order the exchange cancelled after part of it filled now opens on what filled.** The same fix as DCA bots already had: the deal stayed in its starting state with its controls unavailable while the account held the bought coins, and a restart of the bot service placed the entry again on top of them. Combo bots now open the deal on the executed quantity, tell the user once that the entry was cut short, and, on restart, open such a deal instead of buying again. An entry cancelled before anything filled is handled exactly as before.

## [1.62.1] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **A refused spot close no longer places a second take-profit on top of one that may already be live.** When a close was refused for balance and the fee-sizing fallback then found the original close order live on the exchange (or could not rule that out), it correctly did not resend — but the take-profit restore that runs after a refused close did not know that, and rested a fresh full-size take-profit alongside it. On an account where other bots hold the same coin, both could fill and sell twice the deal's position. The restore now stands down in that case.

## [1.62.0] - 2026-09-23

### Changed

- **DCA bots no longer increase orders to meet the exchange minimum by default.** A Base or Safety Order smaller than a pair's minimum order size would be raised to that minimum, placing an order that could be several times the configured size. Now the deal is not opened on that pair and a notification names the pair, each order that is too small with its configured size and the size the minimum would force, the exchange minimum, and what to change. The rest of the bot's pairs keep trading. The new setting "Allow increasing orders to exchange minimum" (`allowRaiseToExchangeMin`) restores the old behaviour. Bots that existed before this release keep the old behaviour: the setting is turned on for them. New bots have it off. Raises of up to 10% (rounding) are always allowed. Terminal deals, Hedge DCA and Combo bots are unchanged. `rejectBelowExchangeMin` from 1.61.0 is replaced by this setting and no longer has any effect.

## [1.61.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added

- **DCA bots can reject orders below the exchange minimum instead of increasing them.** When a Base or Safety Order is smaller than a pair's minimum order size, the bot raises it to that minimum so the exchange accepts it, which can place an order several times the configured size. The new bot setting "Reject Orders Below Exchange Minimum" (`rejectBelowExchangeMin`, off by default) makes the bot skip the deal on that pair instead and send a notification naming the pair, each order that is too small with its configured size and the size the minimum would force, the exchange minimum, and what to change. The rest of the bot's pairs keep trading. The notification is sent once while the condition lasts, not on every attempt. Raises of up to 10% (rounding next to the minimum) are still allowed. Combo bots are unchanged.

## [1.60.21] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **A DCA bot's "Enter Market Timeout" now only runs when it is switched on.** With the switch off, a limit entry order that had not filled was still sent as a market order 35 seconds after the deal opened, so an entry the user had chosen to place at a limit price became a market entry, with taker fees and slippage. With the switch off, an unfilled limit entry is now moved to the current price every 10 seconds until it fills, and is never sent at market. If repositioning is also disabled, the order is left where it is. With the switch on, the order goes to market after the number of seconds set, as before. Closing a deal by limit and the handling of partly filled entries keep their current timing.

## [1.60.20] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **A Combo deal whose entry order was cancelled directly on the exchange, before any of it filled, is now cancelled instead of being left waiting.** The same fix as 1.60.19 for DCA bots: the deal stayed in its starting state and every restart of the bot service placed the entry again. Combo bots now notice a cancel they did not issue themselves and, 15 seconds later, if the deal still has no entry order resting and has not started, cancel the deal as cancelling it from the dashboard would. Grid order cancels are handled exactly as before.

## [1.60.19] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **A DCA deal whose entry order was cancelled directly on the exchange, before any of it filled, is now cancelled instead of being left waiting.** The deal stayed in its starting state with nothing on the exchange, the dashboard offered no action to end it, and every restart of the bot service placed the same entry order again, so a trade the user had already cancelled kept coming back. The bot now notices a cancel it did not issue itself and, 15 seconds later, if the deal still has no entry order resting and has not started, cancels the deal the same way cancelling it from the dashboard would. Cancels the bot makes itself (repositioning, re-sizing, closing), entries that partly filled, and orders the exchange expired on its own are unchanged.

## [1.60.18] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **A neutral futures Grid bot now books its closing position at the price it actually paid for it.** A neutral grid records each completed round trip between two neighbouring grid levels at those two levels' prices. When the bot closed, the position still open was valued against the average entry of every order that had ever added to the position, including orders already counted in completed round trips, instead of against the orders that were actually still open. The close could then show a gain where the bot had a loss (or the reverse), and the bot's total profit no longer matched what it had bought and sold. The close, and the loss booked on a liquidation, are now valued against the orders that no round trip used. If those orders do not add up to the position being closed, the previous valuation is kept. Long and short grids, COIN-M grids, spot grids and the round-trip rows are unchanged (spec 099).

## [1.60.17] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **A DCA bot's take-profit no longer asks to sell more than the deal holds when the exchange charged the entry fee in the coin being bought.** A long spot DCA deal subtracts the entry fee from its close using the fee rate configured for the account. On an account marked as zero-fee that rate is 0, so nothing was subtracted even when the exchange had in fact taken its fee out of the purchased coin, and the exchange refused the close for insufficient balance, leaving the deal with no exit. The close now also reads the fee each filled entry order reports and subtracts whichever is larger, the configured estimate or the fee the exchange actually took in that coin, rounding the result down to the exchange's step. The close can only get smaller because of this, never larger; accounts whose configured rate already covers the fee, short deals and Combo bots are unchanged (spec 098).

## [1.60.16] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **A Combo bot's take-profit no longer asks to sell more than the deal holds when the exchange charged the entry fee in the coin being bought.** A Combo deal sizes its close from its own balance and subtracts the entry fee using the fee rate configured for the account. On an account marked as zero-fee, that rate is 0, so nothing was subtracted even when the exchange had in fact taken its fee out of the purchased coin, and the exchange refused the take-profit for insufficient balance; the bot then put the same oversized order back and the deal was left with no exit. The close now also reads the fee each filled entry order reports and subtracts whichever is larger, the configured estimate or the fee the exchange actually took in that coin. The take-profit can only get smaller because of this, never larger, and accounts whose configured rate already matches are unchanged (spec 097).

## [1.60.15] - 2026-09-23

### Security

- **The login rate limit on a self-hosted server now identifies the caller through Express's `trust proxy` setting.** The limit on credential attempts (and the general API limit), and the address recorded for a login, are now resolved through that setting, driven by a new `TRUST_PROXY` variable. Left unset, the `X-Forwarded-For` header is ignored and the connecting address is used. Behind a reverse proxy, set `TRUST_PROXY` to the number of proxies in front of the server (one nginx → `1`) and have the proxy append the connecting address to `X-Forwarded-For` (nginx: `proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;`); until you do, every client behind that proxy shares one limit (spec 096).

## [1.60.14] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **A DCA deal whose take-profit order is cancelled on the exchange now gets it back within seconds, not at the next restart.** When a resting take-profit was cancelled by someone other than the bot — from the exchange's own interface, or by the exchange itself — with nothing filled, the bot noted nothing and placed nothing, so the deal kept its open position with no exit until the bot was next reloaded, which is the only moment it used to re-place the missing order. The bot now looks at the deal a few seconds after such a cancel and, if it still holds an open position, has no take-profit resting and is not closing, places its planned take-profit again under a new order id — the same order a restart would place. Cancels the bot makes itself (re-sizing a take-profit, closing, stopping, editing a deal) are recorded before they are sent and are never answered this way. Deals that close at market, and Combo bots, are unchanged (spec 095).

## [1.60.13] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **The public API reference now lists `monitoring` as a valid stop status for DCA and Combo bots.** A setting whose type is written inline as a short list of words (for example "closed or monitoring") was documented with only the first word of that list, so the reference said a DCA bot's stop status could only be `closed` — although the API accepts `monitoring` too, and it is the value that leaves a stopped bot watching its open deals. The reference generator now keeps every word of such a list. Of the settings the reference publishes, this was the only one affected. No accepted value changed, and nothing about how a stopped bot behaves changed; only the documentation (spec 094).

## [1.60.12] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **Kraken spot Combo bots now place their grid orders in bulk too.** Bulk order placement on Kraken spot sends up to fifteen orders in one request instead of one request each, which matters because Kraken paces each account's requests and a burst of single placements queues behind that pace. Combo bots were left out: every grid order of a Combo bot belongs to a mini grid, and mini-grid orders were excluded from bulk placement, so the replacement orders a Combo bot sends after a fill still went out one at a time, seconds apart. They are now placed in bulk like any other grid order, including orders from several mini grids of the same deal. Kraken spot only, and only where bulk placement is switched on.

## [1.60.11] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **The public API reference now lists the values each grid take-profit and stop-loss setting accepts, and its examples are values the API actually takes.** Settings whose value comes from a fixed list — the take-profit and stop-loss trigger conditions and actions, how a grid prioritises its levels, the grid type, and the currency the profit and order size are fixed in — were published as free-form objects with no list of choices, and the sample values shown for five of them were not among the values the create endpoint accepts, so anyone building an integration straight from the reference had their request refused. The reference is generated from the platform's own types, and a setting whose type is written as a fixed set of words was not recognised as such and fell through to the generic description. It is now read correctly, so those settings are documented as text with the exact list of permitted values, and the reference is checked against the rules the create endpoint enforces so the two cannot drift apart unnoticed. No accepted value changed; only what the documentation says about them (spec 092).

## [1.60.10] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **A futures bot now follows the position mode your exchange account is actually in.** A futures account is either in one-way mode, where it holds a single net position per contract, or in hedge mode, where the long and the short side are held separately — and every order has to say which of the two it is for, or the exchange refuses it. The platform recorded that setting when the connection was added and when you changed it here, but nothing told it when you changed the setting at the exchange itself, and a bot coming back up after a service restart reused the recorded value instead of asking. An account whose mode had been changed at the exchange therefore had every order from those bots refused — OKX answers "Parameter posSide error", Binance futures reports a position-side mismatch — which left an open position with no orders around it, and each restart repeated it. Bots now read the position mode from the exchange when they start, sharing one read per connection when a whole service restarts so that a restart is no more work than it was, and keep what they read; if the exchange is unreachable the recorded value is still used, exactly as before. An order that is refused for its position side now triggers a re-read and is sent again under the mode the exchange reports, except for a bot that trades both directions and so has no single side of its own, which is left alone rather than guessed at. Nothing on this path ever changes the position mode on your exchange account (spec 091).

## [1.60.9] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **A bot no longer forgets a fill because the exchange announced the order late.** An exchange sends one message per change to an order — it was placed, it traded, it ended — and those messages are not guaranteed to arrive in the order they were sent. The "your order is on the book" message sometimes arrived after the message reporting that part of the order had already traded, and the bot applied it anyway, so its working copy of the order went back to saying nothing had traded yet. Everything that then read the order believed it: a deal's opening order that had really part filled looked untouched, so the machinery that opens the deal on what was actually bought stood down, and the timer that repositions an unfilled entry cancelled it and prepared to buy again on top of a position the account was already holding. A bot now keeps the newest report it has seen of an order and ignores one that is older, on every venue and every bot type (spec 090).

## [1.60.8] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **A futures Grid bot no longer closes with an order larger than the position it holds.** The bot keeps a running total of its open position by adding each order as it fills. Several ordinary situations hand the bot the same filled order a second time — most often when it tears down its grid to close: it cancels the levels it believed were still resting, the exchange answers that one of them is no longer there because it had just filled, and the bot re-reads it and finds it filled. Nothing checked whether that fill had already been counted, so its quantity was added to the running total again, once per repeat, and nothing later corrected it. The take profit or stop loss was then sized from the inflated total. Exchanges that trim a reduce-only order down to the real position absorbed the difference, but an exchange that rejects one instead would have left the close unplaced while the bot treated itself as closed; the same inflated total also fed the profit percentage the take-profit and stop-loss triggers are judged against. Each fill is now counted once no matter how many times it is delivered, and the total a bot rebuilds when it starts is recognised as already counted before it tears down its grid. The profit ledger was never affected — it has always refused a repeated fill (spec 089).

## [1.60.7] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **A DCA deal whose opening order only part filled on the order book is now priced and counted off its whole entry.** When the opening order cannot be filled in full at the limit price, the bot cancels what is left of it and buys the missing part at market, merging the two into one entry. On Coinbase the exchange's own cancellation notice for the original order — which describes only the part that traded on the book, before the market purchase — arrived after that merge and was written back over it in the bot's working copy of its orders. The stored order record stayed correct, so the deal's capital usage was right, but until the bot next reloaded its orders it priced the deal off its safety orders alone and reported one order used where it had used two. The take profit was therefore placed against an average entry price lower than the deal really paid on a long, closing it earlier and for less than configured. The notice can no longer replace an entry the bot has already completed, on any venue (spec 088).

## [1.60.6] - 2026-09-23

### Fixed

- **Kraken spot bots and backtests can use the 3-minute, 2-hour and 8-hour indicator timeframes again.** Kraken's spot candle endpoint does not serve those three widths directly, but each one is an exact multiple of a width it does serve, so the platform builds them by combining the finer bars — a 2-hour candle is precisely two 1-hour candles. The list of timeframes the indicator service would accept for Kraken was never widened to match, so a bot or a backtest asking for one of them was still told the exchange did not support that interval and no indicator was computed, even though the candles were available. Kraken spot now accepts every timeframe its candle path can actually produce. Kraken futures is deliberately unchanged and still declines those three: its candle endpoint takes the timeframe directly and cannot combine finer bars, so the two product lines are now tracked as separate lists rather than one shared one (spec 017).

## [1.60.5] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- **A Combo futures bot no longer opens a position larger than the base order you configured.** A Combo bot lays a small grid over its base order, and on futures the base order is re-sized to the sum of that grid's levels so the position and the ladder that unwinds it are the same size. When the base order's value is split across more levels than it can pay for at the exchange's smallest allowed order size, every level has to be raised to that minimum — and the base order inherited the inflated total, opening a position materially larger than the configured one, with nothing said. The larger the level count, the larger the excess. The bot now refuses to open a deal on such a pair and says what budget the level count actually needs, instead of committing capital you did not ask it to. The refusal is per pair, so the bot keeps trading the pairs it can fund, and it is reported once rather than on every cycle. Pairs whose budget does fund every level are sized exactly as before (spec 087).

## [1.60.4] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- **A Combo futures bot opens its base order at the size you configured, instead of a fraction of it.** A Combo bot lays a small grid over its base order, and on futures the base order is deliberately re-sized to the sum of that grid's levels so the position and the ladder that unwinds it are the same size. Each level was being rounded down to the exchange's quantity step on its own, though, so the grid lost up to one step on *every* level — and the base order inherited the whole loss. On a contract with a coarse quantity step this was severe: a base order configured as a notional value and split across five grid levels could open a position worth barely half of it. Each level now carries its rounding remainder into the next one, so the levels still sit exactly on the exchange's step but their total lands on the configured size instead of under it. The total is still rounded down, so the bot never commits more than you asked for. Spot Combo bots and grid bots are unchanged, as are grids the exchange's own minimum order size already governs (spec 086).

## [1.60.3] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- **A deal opened at the exchange's smallest allowed size can now pay for its own take-profit.** When the base order you configured is worth less than the minimum the exchange will accept, the engine raises it so the deal can still rest a take-profit that clears the same minimum. The raise added one fee on top of the minimum, but the take-profit it was paying for is one fee *below* the position — and adding a fee does not undo subtracting one. The gap is tiny, about one part in a million, but it lands on the wrong side of the line: the take-profit came out just under the exchange's minimum, was rounded back up to it, and then asked to sell marginally more of the coin than the deal was ever credited. The exchange refused it for insufficient funds every time, so such a deal sat open with no take-profit on the book until one of its safety orders filled. The raise is now the exact inverse of the fee the close pays, so the take-profit clears the minimum with the position that actually exists. Deals not sized at an exchange minimum, short deals, futures deals and accounts whose fees are charged in a third coin are unaffected (spec 085).

## [1.60.2] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- **Two spot orders the exchange could only refuse are no longer sent.** When a deal ends with part of its position unfilled, the engine trades the remainder back. It checked that remainder against the exchange's minimum quantity and minimum order value *before* rounding it onto the symbol's quantity step — so on a market with a coarse step, a remainder that cleared both minimums could round away to nothing and still be submitted, as an order for zero units. The remainder is now rounded first and both minimums are measured against the quantity that will actually be sent, together with an explicit check that it is above zero: some venues publish a minimum quantity of zero, so the minimum alone cannot catch this.
- **A Bitget spot market buy is no longer sized to more decimals than the venue accepts.** A spot market buy is sized in the quote coin, and that amount was rounded to the number of decimals Bitget publishes for the symbol. For some symbols that published figure is larger than what Bitget's own order validator accepts, so those orders were rejected on submission every time. The amount is now capped at the scale the venue really takes; symbols already within it are unchanged.
- An order whose quantity is zero is now refused before it reaches the exchange, alongside the existing refusal of a quantity that is not a number. No venue accepts a zero-size order, so this cannot cost a fill, and it bounds any other path that rounds a size away (spec 084).

## [1.60.1] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- **A deal whose close the exchange refused now really does get its take-profit put back on the book.** Closing a deal cancels the resting take-profit before it sends the closing order, so when the exchange refuses that order the deal is left holding its whole position with nothing on the book — and since a take-profit is only ever re-created as a side effect of a fill, nothing was left that could fill to put one back. The recovery written for exactly this case was itself being skipped: it ran into a guard whose job is to stop new orders being placed while a close is in flight, and for an automatic close — a stop loss, an indicator exit, or a trailing take profit the venue refused for a reason retrying cannot fix — that "closing" marker is set before the close is attempted and is not cleared when the close fails for good. So the engine announced it was restoring the take-profit and then sent nothing. The recovery is now exempt from that guard, which is sound because it is only ever reached once the close has terminally failed; every other caller is still held back while a close really is in flight, and the recovery still refuses to add a second close when one is already resting (spec 083).

## [1.60.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added

- Kraken spot bots can cancel a whole set of resting orders in one exchange call instead of one call per order. Kraken meters private requests against a bucket of 20 refilling at 0.5/s and a single cancel spends two of them, so a teardown of many orders spent its budget on the first few and then waited seconds for each of the rest; the venue's own bulk cancel does the same work for one request. Every order still ends in the same state by the same code path, an order the bulk call does not vouch for is still cancelled on its own, and every other exchange is untouched. Off by default, armed per bot with `BOT_BATCH_CANCEL` (spec 082).
- Kraken spot bots can also place a burst of limit orders in one exchange call, in groups of up to 15, which is the venue's published maximum. Each order still gets its own answer and still runs its own bookkeeping one order at a time, in the same sequence as before — only the request itself is shared. A batch whose outcome the transport cannot describe is resolved against the exchange order by order before anything is sent again, so a lost response can neither duplicate a live order nor write one off. Off by default, armed per bot with `BOT_BATCH_PLACE` (spec 082).
## [1.59.65] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- **Stopping a grid bot no longer records a manual buy in its event log.** The grid start dialog lets you choose how the initial buy is placed, and the dashboards carry that choice on every status change they send, a stop included. The event log wrote a "Manual buy" entry whenever that field was merely present, rather than when the choice was actually applied — so a plain Stop left behind a "Manual buy — Buy type: all" entry for an action that placed no order and in which the choice was discarded, and DCA, combo and hedge bots recorded the same entry even though they have no such dialog and never receive the value. The entry is now written only for the one case that applies the choice: a grid bot being started. Genuine grid starts are unchanged, and no order placement is affected — this is the event log only.

## [1.59.64] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- **A deal that has withdrawn funds is no longer measured as holding less than it does.** The check that asks how much a deal still holds — used to judge whether its close covers the position, and to cap how far a close may be raised to clear an exchange's minimum order value — subtracted every completed withdrawal from the deal's recorded position. That position is already recorded net of completed withdrawals, so the withdrawn amount came off twice and the deal was measured as holding less than it really did, by exactly what had been withdrawn. A fully covered deal could therefore read as over-covered, and a close that the deal could afford could be held below the exchange's minimum. Withdrawals that are still queued have not happened yet, are still part of the position, and are deliberately still excluded from what a close may cover.

## [1.59.63] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- **Withdrawing funds from a deal no longer leaves that amount counted both as still held and as already withdrawn.** A deal reconstructs how much it originally entered by adding what it has withdrawn back onto the position it currently holds. The withdrawal was recorded the moment its order filled, while the held position was refreshed a moment later, so in between the same amount was counted in both places and the deal read as having entered more than it did. A take-profit priced in that brief window was sized for the position the deal held before the withdrawal — larger than what was actually held, which on an account that keeps one net position per symbol would not have closed the deal but reversed it. Withdrawal and position are now recorded in a single step, so the two always agree.

## [1.59.62] - 2026-09-22

### Fixed

- **A bot refused for an existing position now says what is holding that position, and only waits when waiting can change the answer.** On an account that keeps one net position per symbol, a bot whose direction fights an open position cannot start — its closing orders would be refused and its deal would be stranded. The refusal named the direction of the position and nothing else, which sent people to their exchange to look at a position that usually belongs to the opposite bot they had just stopped. The refusal now looks up which bot holds the position and says so: that it belongs to an open deal on a named bot which is still running, or to one on a bot that is stopped — stopping a bot without asking it to close leaves the position exactly where it was — or that no deal on the account holds it at all, in which case nothing on this side is going to close it and it has to be closed at the exchange. How long the start waits before refusing now follows the same answer. A close that is already on its way is given about a minute instead of ten seconds, and so is a position no deal owns, since both can go away on their own; a bot that is running and holding an open deal on the other side is not unwinding anything, so that start is refused promptly rather than sitting silent for a minute to reach the same conclusion. The first sentence of the message is unchanged.
- **A close sent by webhook now finishes before the next action in the same payload runs.** A payload can carry several actions and they are performed in order, but a close was only handed to the bot that owns it, so the next action began while the close was still in flight. Reversing a position in one payload — close one side, start the other — therefore started the second bot against a position the first was still closing, and it was refused for holding a position against its own direction. A close that is meant to flatten is now waited on, for up to about fifteen seconds, before the payload moves on. A close that has not completed in that time is not waited on further, and the start that follows behaves as it did before. Stopping a bot while leaving its position open is not waited on at all: it closes nothing by design.

## [1.59.61] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- A combo bot no longer keeps funds reserved for a grid order the exchange has
  cancelled. A cancelled grid level was only removed from the bot's ladder when
  it had expired AND sat on the side that closes the position, so on a long bot
  a cancelled buy stayed on the ladder for the life of the mini grid: the level
  counts kept counting it and the deal kept quote reserved for an order that was
  no longer on the book. With less free quote than it really had, the deal could
  not re-place those levels, and the gap they left never filled back in. A grid
  order the exchange reports cancelled or expired is now taken off the ladder
  whichever side it was on, the level counts and reserved amounts are
  recalculated from what is left, and a level another order is still resting on
  is left alone (spec 077).

## [1.59.60] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- Saving your settings now refuses a time zone the app cannot resolve instead
  of storing it and reporting it saved. The time zone on your account is the
  day boundary your profit history is grouped by, and a value that is not a
  real zone — a country name, an offset label, a misspelled city — was stored
  as given and then quietly treated as UTC, so the figures were grouped on
  days that did not match the setting, with nothing to say so. A zone that
  cannot be resolved is now rejected with a message, and leaving the field
  unset is still fine. Zones already saved are unchanged (spec 076).

## [1.59.59] - 2026-09-21

### Changed

- Setting a password now applies one rule everywhere. Changing your password,
  resetting it and the command-line reset each used to apply a different
  standard, so a password accepted by one could be refused by another and the
  form could only ever match one of them. The rule is now 8 to 200 characters
  with an uppercase letter, a lowercase letter and a number, and a rejection
  says so instead of only reporting that the password was not valid. Existing
  passwords are unaffected: signing in does not apply this rule.

## [1.59.58] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- A futures deal is no longer left open forever when the exchange refuses its closing order because there is no position left to reduce. The engine already settles a deal in that situation — a reduce-only close can never be accepted against a flat position, so there is nothing to retry — but it recognised only one of the two ways this exchange words the refusal. The second wording, the one that names the position's direction, fell through to the generic handler instead: the deal stayed open holding a position the exchange said was not there, and every later close attempt was refused identically. Both wordings are now recognised. The refusal is scoped by the exchange to the direction the deal itself asked to reduce, so on a hedged account the opposite leg is untouched (spec 075).

## [1.59.57] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- A deal whose close the exchange refused no longer re-sends the same refused order on every subsequent close attempt. Putting a take-profit back on the book after a refused close is a recovery step, and it sat in a branch the engine re-enters each time it retries the close, so a deal the exchange keeps refusing re-sent the identical order and re-raised the identical warning at the retry cadence for as long as it stayed open. It is now attempted once per deal per cooldown window, on the same 5 minute to 1 hour ladder the other repeat-rejection guards use, and the window is dropped the moment a take-profit actually rests. The close itself keeps its own retry cadence, so a shortfall that clears is still picked up immediately (spec 074).
- That recovery is also no longer attempted after refusals it cannot answer. A re-armed take-profit sells exactly the base the refused close was sizing, so it can only ever answer a refusal about funding that base; it was also firing after a revoked or unpermitted API key, an IP allow-list rejection and a contract with no position left to reduce, each producing a second doomed order and a message naming funding as the cause when funding was not the cause. Those refusals now keep the exchange's own reason as their only report (spec 074).

## [1.59.56] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- A futures grid bot's `valueChanged` take-profit / stop-loss now triggers where the setting says. The open position's live value was computed as `qty * ((last - entry) / entry) * last` — the true value `qty * (last - entry)` scaled by `last / entry` — which understated a long's open loss, so the stop ran on past its setting, and overstated a short's, so it fired early. The drawdown and run-up statistics were built from the same expression and carry the same correction (spec 064).
- A grid bot's last window of drawdown, run-up and time-in-loss is no longer discarded. A grid bot is sampled at most once a minute and nothing removed it from the stats monitor, so the window it stops in — the one holding the move that fired the stop — was never sampled and never written. The bot now takes one final measurement at the price it is stopping on and flushes it before the closing order, bounded so a stalled write cannot hold up the close. The same flush-before-delete was missing on the DCA/combo deal-close path (spec 064).
- Grid levels that fill inside one price message each book their own realized profit. The per-fill work was serialised per FILL, so fills delivered together all read the same running total before writing theirs, and every one but the last vanished from the transaction ledger's cumulative — and from the bot profit the take-profit / stop-loss check reads. It is now serialised per bot. A closing leg is also carried into the bot's in-memory profit, not only into its document, so the next round trip adds to it instead of replacing it (spec 073).

## [1.59.55] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- A bot no longer loses its pair when that pair stops being listed on the exchange. The engine prunes a delisted pair from a bot's pair list, which is right for a bot trading several pairs but emptied a single-pair bot completely: it was stopped with nothing configured to trade, and because a single-pair bot refuses pair changes, the only way back was to rebuild the bot and lose its history. A bot that would lose every pair now keeps its pairs and is simply stopped, so it resumes on a restart if the contract is listed again. A bot trading several pairs still loses the delisted ones and keeps running on the rest (spec 072).
- A DCA or combo bot whose single pair was already emptied this way can now be given one pair back. The refusal that protects a configured single-pair bot from a pair swap is unchanged; it no longer applies to a bot that has no pair at all. The new pair must be exactly one, and the bot's base/quote assets are re-derived from it.

## [1.59.54] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- The add-exchange failure log line now identifies the credential by a short, non-reversible fingerprint. The line fires whenever a venue refuses a verification, and a refusal is not a verdict on the key — an IP restriction, a missing trade permission or a wrong regional origin all refuse a perfectly live credential. The fingerprint is the same djb2 hash `exchange-connector-sh` uses, so one credential can still be matched across the two services' logs (spec 071).

## [1.59.53] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- On a venue whose balance stream reports a wallet total and no hold, the funds an order holds now appear within seconds of the order resting, filling or being cancelled, instead of waiting for the next periodic balance refresh. The order events already arrive on the same stream, so one refresh is scheduled per connection per short window — a ladder that rests many orders at once costs a single call. Venues that stream their own hold are untouched (spec 070; follows spec 069).

## [1.59.52] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- A grid bot whose budget is too small to fund every level at the exchange's minimum order size now refuses to start and says what budget the range and level count need. Before, the sizing routine raised every level to the exchange minimum without a word, so the grid — and the start order sized from it — committed a multiple of the configured budget; on futures the start order's balance check divides by leverage, so the inflated order could pass and fill. Refused only when the needed budget exceeds the configured one by more than 10 %. Applies to a user-initiated start only: a service restart and a settings-edit reload are never refused, and no quantity of a bot that passes is sized differently (spec 068).

## [1.59.51] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed

- A streamed balance item with no `locked` field is a wallet total, and is now stored as one: the hold already on the row is taken out of it before `free` is written or pushed to the dashboard. Stored verbatim next to a real hold it made `free + locked` exceed the wallet until the next REST refresh. Items that carry their own `locked` are unchanged (spec 069; pairs with `exchange-connector-sh` 1.22.2, which makes Kraken spot report its hold).

## [1.59.50] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- The API rejected the pair format its own reads return, so a bot read from
  the API could not be created back through it. A bot stores and returns its
  pair as the exchange-native symbol (`ARBUSDT`), while the create endpoints
  accepted only the `BASE_QUOTE` input format (`ARB_USDT`) and answered
  anything else with `Field pair contains invalid entries`. Pair resolution is
  now keyed on the exchange-native symbol first and falls back to splitting on
  the separator, so both formats are accepted and both resolve to the same
  instrument. This also reaches pairs the separator split could never handle -
  dated delivery contracts (`BTCUSDT_250627`) and `*_PERP` symbols, where
  splitting produced a nonsense base and quote; the X-Perp special case that
  existed for one suffix is now the general rule. Affects grid, DCA and combo
  creation and terminal deals.
- Cloning a grid bot without naming a pair rebuilt the pair from the bot's
  base and quote assets. That value matches no listed market, so the clone was
  stored with an empty base and quote and a pair string the venue does not
  know - and on a venue listing several contracts against one base/quote it
  named a different instrument than the bot being cloned. A clone now reuses
  the source bot's pair exactly as stored, for every bot type.

## [1.59.49] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- Reading a grid bot from the API returned only part of its configuration, so
  a copy created from what was read was not the bot that was read. The
  `extended` field preset for grid bots named 13 of the 38 settings the create
  endpoint merges a request against, and the create endpoint replaces anything
  the body omits with the platform default. The take profit and stop loss
  **flags, conditions and actions** were readable while their **thresholds**
  were not, so a copy was created with its stop loss armed and its trigger
  reset to the default — a flag without its threshold is not a configuration.
  The budget, grid step, orders in advance, sell displacement and the profit /
  order currencies were also unreadable, so the copy traded a different size on
  a different grid; and the margin type, leverage and strategy settings were
  unreadable, so a cross-margin 5x futures grid was copied as an isolated 1x
  one with a different direction. Nothing errored and nothing warned — the response
  looked complete and its metadata honestly named the preset it had used. The
  preset now covers every setting the create endpoint accepts, so a
  read-modify-create round trip keeps the bot's configuration. The change is
  additive: no field was removed or renamed, and the two settings the create
  endpoint explicitly refuses are still not returned, so echoing the response
  back does not fail validation. Grid bot listings and the bot details endpoint
  share the preset and are both fixed. `fields=full` and explicit field lists
  are unaffected.

## [1.59.48] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- Paginated API listings could omit rows. Every paged endpoint ordered its
  results by a single field that is not unique — the asset for balances, the
  creation time for bots, deals, global variables, hedge bots and backtest
  requests — and rows sharing that value have no defined order between them.
  Each page is a separate query, so a group of tied rows sitting on a page
  boundary could come back twice on one page and not at all on the next. The
  page still looked full and the reported total still matched, so a caller
  reading every page had no way to notice: a de-duplicating client dropped the
  repeat and kept the gap. Account-wide balance reads were the worst affected,
  because one row exists per connection and asset, so an asset held on several
  connections ties once per connection. Listings are now ordered with a unique
  tiebreaker, which makes paging deterministic and complete. The response shape
  and page size are unchanged; only the order of rows that share a value — and
  was previously arbitrary — can differ. Account-wide balance listings are also
  now served by an index instead of an in-memory sort.

## [1.59.47] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- `GET /api/v2/bots/{botType}/details` read every bot type with the DCA field
  preset. The bot type is a path parameter, but the route bound its field
  preset once, when it was registered, so `fields=minimal|standard|extended`
  always resolved against the DCA configuration. A grid bot fetched there came
  back without any of its grid definition — no price range, no level count, no
  grid type, no take-profit / stop-loss configuration, no stored symbol, level
  counts, initial or average price — and a combo bot without its deal
  statistics, while the response metadata named the DCA fields it had used.
  Because the create endpoint fills any setting a request omits from the
  platform defaults, reading a grid bot from this endpoint, adjusting a value
  and creating the adjusted copy produced a bot with an empty price range, the
  default level count and its take profit and stop loss disarmed. The endpoint
  now resolves the preset from the bot type on every request and reports the
  one it used. Additive on the wire: no field that was returned before is
  missing now, DCA responses are unchanged, and `fields=full` and explicit
  field lists are unaffected. Not every grid setting is readable from this
  endpoint yet, so the copy round trip is much improved but not yet lossless.

## [1.59.46] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- The DCA and combo bot list endpoints now return the fields their `standard`
  and `extended` presets promise, and a DCA or combo deal returns its safety
  order size and count. Several of the paths those presets projected — the
  created/updated timestamps, the stop loss, the trailing deviation and the
  safety trade count on a bot, and the safety order size and count on a deal —
  were spelled differently from the way the documents store them, so they
  resolved to nothing and were simply left out of the response, with no error:
  `standard` returned no timestamps at all, and `extended` returned only the
  base order size of the four settings it names. Because the create endpoint
  fills any setting a request omits from the platform defaults, reading a bot
  through a preset, changing a value and creating the adjusted copy quietly
  disarmed the stop loss and the trailing take profit and reset the
  safety-order ladder. The presets now name the stored paths, and each value
  travels with the boolean that arms it so that round trip keeps it. Field
  names that never resolved are the only ones removed; `full` and explicit
  field lists are unaffected.

## [1.59.45] - 2026-09-20

### Fixed

- The grid bot list endpoint now returns the fields its `standard` and
  `extended` presets promise. Five of the paths those presets projected — the
  pair, the level count, the two range prices and the created/updated
  timestamps — were spelled differently from the way a grid bot stores them, so
  they resolved to nothing and were simply left out of the response, with no
  error: `standard` identified a bot by name only, and `extended` added the
  grid type and nothing else of the configuration. Because the create endpoint
  fills any setting a request omits from the platform defaults, reading a bot
  through a preset, changing a value and creating the adjusted copy quietly
  reset every setting that could not be read back — the take profit and stop
  loss actions among them, which fell back to "stop and cancel orders" instead
  of the configured action. The presets now name the stored paths, and
  `extended` carries the full take profit / stop loss configuration so that
  round trip keeps it. Field names that never resolved are the only ones
  removed; `full` and explicit field lists are unaffected.

## [1.59.44] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- A DCA deal's average entry price no longer counts a market-bought remainder
  twice. When part of an entry order does not fill, the bot buys the rest at
  market and merges that fill back into the original order's quantity, quote
  and price — so the remainder's own record is a receipt for units the parent
  order already reports. The average-price calculation was the one ledger that
  did not skip it, folding those units a second time and pulling the average
  toward the price the remainder happened to get. Because the remainder record
  is dropped when a bot reloads its orders, the same deal could show either
  value depending on when the average was last computed. The average sets the
  safety-order ladder and the take-profit, so on a long an overstated average
  held the deal open past the configured target. Both the spot and the futures
  calculation now skip it; balance-correction orders, which have no parent to
  duplicate, are still counted.

## [1.59.43] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- A DCA base order that stopped part filled is now opened into its deal even on
  venues whose cancel reply does not report fills. Cancelling the remainder is
  what settles such an entry, and the reply to that cancel was taken as the
  final word on how much had traded — on a venue that answers only "the order is
  gone", that overwrote the fill the bot had already seen with a zero, and the
  deal was left in `start` with no average price, cost, take profit or stop
  loss, holding a position nothing was tracking and occupying one of the bot's
  open-deal slots until the bot was restarted. The quantity and price are now
  taken from whichever report states them, an order's executed quantity never
  being able to decrease. A cancel that gets no answer at all is unchanged and
  still waits, because the remainder may still be live.
- A base order promoted after the venue ended it is now written to the order
  record. The write could not pass the filter that protects rows already in a
  final state, which such a row always is, so the promotion stayed in memory and
  the deal lost its base-order record the next time the bot reloaded.

## [1.59.42] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- A base order that only partly filled before the bot bought the rest at market
  now records the whole entry. The market top-up was merged into the base order
  in memory but never written back, so the deal opened correctly and then, the
  next time the bot reloaded its orders, reverted to only the part that had
  filled on the order book. The cost, size, average price, capital usage and
  realised profit of such a deal were all understated by the amount bought at
  market, and its base balance could read as a short position the account never
  held.

## [1.59.41] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- The backtest engine this backend installs is now the same build the
  dashboard runs. It had been pinned one release behind, so a backtest run on
  the server used an engine in which a futures grid closed by "stop and sell"
  recorded no transaction for the closing trade: the Transactions list ended
  on the last grid fill and did not add up to the reported total profit, and
  the closing trade — usually a loss — was missing from the transaction count,
  the average transaction profit and the Sharpe/Sortino ratios. Running the
  same strategy in the browser and on the server now returns the same ledger.

## [1.59.40] - 2026-09-19

### Added

- A guard for armed trailing take profits and trailing stops: once armed, a
  trail's level may never sit further from the current price than one trail
  width. The guard compares the level with the one the engine itself would set
  at the current price. It ships in a report-only (shadow) mode: it logs any
  trail that has fallen behind and changes nothing. A runtime switch moves it
  to enforcing, where it moves such a level up to the current price, or turns
  it off. A deal whose close is being retried keeps its level.

## [1.59.39] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- Adding or reducing funds on a deal could write an earlier pending addition
  or reduction that filled while the new order was being placed back as still
  pending, and recompute the deal's balances from the state before that fill.
  Both now use the deal as it is after the order is placed.
- A safety-order or take-profit fill processed while a stop-loss close was
  being triggered could clear the close's in-flight markers, so the next price
  tick could trigger the same stop loss again. The markers set meanwhile are
  now kept.
- A trailing take-profit or trailing stop check could record a new price
  extreme on an outdated copy of the deal when the deal was updated during the
  check, losing that tick's move. It now works on the current deal.

## [1.59.38] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- A trailing take profit on a DCA deal that had averaged down could stop
  following the price. Each safety-order fill is meant to restart the trail
  from the new average, but since 1.58.13 that restart was dropped: the fill
  now saves its fee ledger first, which replaces the deal in memory with a copy,
  and the restart was written to the old copy. The trail then kept measuring
  from the deal's opening price, so once armed its level did not move until
  price climbed back above that opening price, and the deal closed at (or sat
  below) the level where it first armed instead of trailing the rally. The
  restart now reaches the live deal, and a trailing take profit also starts
  following from the price at which it arms.
- A funding settlement on a futures deal wrote its earlier copy of the deal
  back into memory, undoing any update made to that deal while the funding was
  being computed — for example a safety-order fill's new average and balances.
  The funding is now applied to the deal as it currently is.

## [1.59.37] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- A DCA base order that only filled part way now has the missing part bought at
  market before the deal opens, so the deal is sized on the base order size you
  configured. Previously the entry was settled on whatever had executed and the
  rest was simply dropped: the deal's take profit, safety-order ladder and usage
  were all derived from the fraction that filled, which could leave the first
  safety order many times the size of the base it was averaging into. The
  top-up reuses the existing remainder machinery, so a remainder below the
  exchange's minimum order size is still left alone, and it only applies while
  the entry decision is current — an entry recovered hours later by a bot
  restart is opened on what filled, as before (spec `057`). Coinbase market
  orders are immediate-or-cancel and report a partial fill as cancelled; that
  shape is now recognised, so a partly filled top-up is recorded against the
  deal instead of being lost.

## [1.59.36] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Changing a DCA bot's indicator safety-order sizes no longer resizes the deals
  that are already running. On an indicator ladder each "start DCA" indicator
  carries its own order size and minimum distance from the last fill, and those
  were read from the bot's current settings rather than from the deal — so a
  deal opened with small safety orders would fill its next one at the size
  configured for new deals. Each deal now keeps the indicator sizes and
  distances it opened with (spec `056`). Which indicators trigger a safety
  order still follows the bot. Deals opened before this release keep the
  previous behaviour until they close.

## [1.59.35] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- Closing a DCA or combo deal that has already finished now answers "Deal
  already closed" or "Deal already canceled" instead of "Deal not found". A
  screen still showing the deal as open can now tell that it is finished rather
  than missing, instead of offering a close that can never succeed.

## [1.59.34] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- A deal whose close the venue refuses no longer locks up. When a close is
  refused, the engine puts a take-profit back on the book — but it did so
  through the order-placement method, which is serialised on the same per-deal
  key the close itself already holds. That lock is not reentrant and has no
  timeout, so the close ended up waiting on itself: the take-profit was never
  actually restored, and the deal's key was never released. Everything that
  needed the deal afterwards then blocked on it, including stopping the bot —
  a stop reported success, wrote no status event and left the bot running,
  and every later stop attempt queued silently behind the first. The restore
  now runs under the lock the close already holds, so it completes; every
  other caller keeps taking the lock exactly as before. A bot whose deal
  cannot be closed for lack of funds can be stopped again, and the refused
  close is reported instead of hanging.

## [1.59.33] - 2026-09-18

### Fixed

- A failed balance read is no longer reported as a balance of zero. When the
  engine could not read an account's balances — a venue timeout, a connector
  error, a dropped connection — the balance check scored every asset as 0 and
  the bot warned "Not enough balance to start new deal … available: 0" against
  accounts that were fully funded. A read that did not land is now
  distinguishable from an account that genuinely holds nothing: the deal is
  skipped for that cycle and the pair re-armed, exactly as when the latest
  price is unavailable, and the read failure is reported once on its own
  instead of a second, contradictory message about the user's funds. A genuine
  shortfall is reported exactly as before.
- The "not enough balance to start new deal" alert now names the pair the
  refusal happened on, instead of the bot's first configured pair.

## [1.59.32] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- Closing a deal replaces its resting take-profit: the take-profit is cancelled
  and a close is sent in its place. If the exchange refused that close — most
  often because the account could not fund it — the engine reported the refusal
  and stopped there, leaving the deal open, still holding its whole position,
  with no order of any kind on the exchange. Because a take-profit is otherwise
  only re-armed as a side effect of an order filling, and there was no longer
  anything that could fill, such a deal could not recover on its own and stayed
  open indefinitely. A refused close now restores a take-profit sized from that
  deal's own position, and only when the deal is still open and has nothing
  resting — so it can neither duplicate a live order nor act on a deal that has
  since closed.
- When even that restored take-profit cannot be placed, the deal is genuinely
  unfundable from its own position. That is now stated to the user as its own
  message rather than being folded into the daily-coalesced balance warning,
  which stops being refreshed once the repeated-refusal guard engages — so a
  position could sit uncovered for weeks with nothing to show for it.
- Adaptive close re-sizes a refused close to the free balance of the base asset.
  That balance belongs to the whole wallet, which on a spot account is shared
  with every other bot and deal trading the same asset, so the re-sized close
  could be larger than the position the deal itself holds. It is now also capped
  at that deal's own remaining position. A bot accounts against its own
  allocation only; no balance belonging to another deal is inspected or
  subtracted.

## [1.59.31] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- When an exchange refuses a market base order because the order book is in
  limit-only mode, the bot re-places that base order as a limit order so the
  deal still enters rather than being left with nothing on the exchange. That
  substitution is now reported to the user instead of only being written to the
  engine log: a bot message names the pair, says the venue would not accept a
  market entry, says the base order was placed as a limit order instead, and
  asks for the bot's entry settings to be changed. A bot configured to enter at
  market could previously keep entering at limit indefinitely with nothing to
  show for it. The message is raised once per deal rather than once per
  reposition attempt, and is grouped per trading pair, since limit-only mode
  applies to one pair at a time. Both entry configurations are covered: a limit
  entry that falls back to market after its timeout, and a market entry whose
  very first order is refused.

## [1.59.30] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- The check that watches whether a deal's resting take profit still covers the
  position it protects measured contract-based futures markets in the wrong
  unit. Those markets are sized in contracts rather than in the traded coin,
  and the check was comparing the exchange's contract count against a position
  measured in coin. A deal whose take profit was sized exactly right could
  therefore be reported as offering far more — or far less — cover than the
  deal actually owned, and by the same mismatch a position that genuinely had
  too little cover could be reported as safe. Both sides of the comparison are
  now brought into a single unit first. On inverse (coin-margined) markets that
  unit is contracts, with each part of the position converted at the price it
  actually traded at, and the message now says which unit it counted in; on the
  other contract-based futures markets the exchange's figure is converted back
  to the traded coin instead. Nothing changes for markets that are not
  contract-based, and the check still only reports unless the repair is
  explicitly switched on.

## [1.59.29] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed

- A trailing take profit the exchange refused was never retried. When the
  trailing take profit fires, the deal has already traded through its take
  profit and is in profit — and that profit only lasts as long as the price
  does. The engine made exactly one attempt: if the exchange refused the
  closing order for a reason of its own — a temporary lockout, a rate-limit
  ban, a 5xx — the exit was simply abandoned, nothing was said about it, and on
  a bot with stop loss switched off there was nothing else left to close the
  deal. Such a close is now retried up to five times, waiting progressively
  longer between attempts (30 seconds to a minute), and the retry is recorded
  on the deal so it survives a restart of the platform and so no price tick can
  fire a second, overlapping close while it is outstanding. Refusals that
  retrying cannot fix are unchanged: not enough balance, insufficient margin, a
  rejected order size or price, a dead API key, a trading restriction, or a
  failure whose outcome is unknown (a timeout, where the order may in fact have
  reached the exchange). Each retry re-checks that the deal is still open and
  still above break even first, so a retry can never become a closing order at
  a loss. If every retry is refused, the bot now says so: the deal is reported
  as needing your attention, with the exchange's own reason, and the trailing
  take profit is paused rather than left armed — so a bot restarted days later
  cannot close the deal at whatever the price has become by then. The pause
  lifts, and the whole trailing take profit re-arms with a fresh set of
  retries, once the price crosses back over the take-profit level.

### Added

- Deals returned by the public API v2 now carry `trailingClose` on the
  `standard` field preset: it says whether a trailing take-profit close is
  being retried or has been paused after failing, how many attempts were
  refused, when the next one is due, and the exchange's own reason.

## [1.59.28] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- A trailing take profit could close a deal at a loss. Once the trailing take
  profit is armed, the deal has already traded through its take-profit price
  and the trail exists to capture more than it. The close, however, was decided
  purely by the price crossing the armed level, with no reference to what the
  deal had cost — so if anything left that level armed while the price walked
  away from it, the trail acted as an unbounded stop loss and closed at
  whatever the price had since become. That could happen when the exchange
  rejected the closing order, since the trail was left armed and the guard that
  suppresses a repeat attempt only lives as long as the process does; when a
  restart re-registered the stale level; or after a safety order filled, which
  makes the trail re-arm just under the current price while the deal is under
  water. On a bot with stop loss switched off, the trailing take profit is the
  only thing that can close a deal, so nothing else bounded the result. A
  trailing take profit now refuses to close below the deal's break-even price
  — its average entry plus the round-trip taker fee — and disarms instead,
  re-arming only once price is back above the take profit. A trailing stop
  loss and an ordinary stop loss are unchanged: they exist to take losses. A
  closing order the exchange rejects outright now disarms the trail as well,
  rather than leaving the level to fire later.

## [1.59.27] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- Changing a bot's order sizing erased its P&L trend chart. Editing base order
  size, order size, the number of safety orders, volume scale, order size type,
  the maximum number of open deals, or turning DCA on or off resets the bot's
  statistics, because every average and ratio in them is measured against a
  starting balance the edit has just changed. That reset also cleared the daily
  equity series behind the mini trend chart on the bot card and the performance
  chart in the bot drawer — a record of what the account was actually worth on
  each of the last 90 days, which a change to the size of future orders does
  not invalidate. The series is only ever rebuilt while a bot is running, once
  a day or as deals close, so a bot stopped after such an edit showed "No data"
  permanently, and one with a single day of closed deals since showed a lone
  point with no line. The equity series now survives an order-sizing change;
  changing the profit currency still clears the statistics in full, since it
  re-denominates them. Bots whose series was already cleared rebuild it as they
  keep trading.

## [1.59.26] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- Sharing a backtest that the server no longer holds failed with no
  explanation. Backtest runs that are not marked to keep are cleaned up
  automatically after 30 days, and a run whose save never reached the server is
  only ever held in the browser — in both cases the dashboard still lists the
  result, and pressing Share on it produced a generic failure with nothing to
  act on. Every share action (DCA, Combo, Grid and both Hedge types) now
  answers "Backtest not found" for an id that resolves to no stored backtest,
  including one that cannot be a stored id at all. Sharing a backtest the
  server does hold is unchanged, and a result that was already shared still
  returns its existing link.

## [1.59.25] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- Some exchanges answer repeated failed authentication by temporarily locking
  the account, and restart that lock on every further attempt made while it is
  in force. Background readers treated the lockout as an ordinary transient
  error and kept re-checking the account on their normal schedule, so the lock
  was continually renewed and an account could stay locked indefinitely — even
  when the API key itself was fine. A lockout now puts the account on its own
  cooldown, long enough to outlast both the exchange's lock and the slowest
  background schedule, so the lock is left alone and allowed to expire. Once it
  does, the exchange's real answer is visible again and the existing handling
  for a genuinely invalid key applies unchanged. Expired- and revoked-key
  detection is untouched: a lockout is not treated as a bad key, so it cannot
  cause a working key to be disabled.

## [1.59.24] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- A DCA deal whose opening order was cancelled by the exchange after it had
  already bought part of the requested amount now opens on the amount that was
  actually bought, and says so in the deal's history. Before, the executed part
  was discarded: the deal stayed at 0 of N levels with no cost, no average
  price, no take profit and no stop loss, while the coins it had bought sat in
  the account outside any deal, and nothing told you it had happened. The
  bot's next start made it worse by treating the deal as never started and
  sending the opening order a second time, on top of the position already held.
  This shape reaches deals entered at market, which arm none of the timers the
  previous fix in this area relied on.

## [1.59.23] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- The container now starts again. A test-only helper — the in-memory database
  used by the automated test suite — was being loaded at startup even though it
  is only ever used when the test suite runs. That helper is deliberately not
  installed in the released image, so the process aborted while loading its
  modules, before it read any configuration or contacted the database. Every
  workload built from the image failed the same way and restarted in a loop.
  The helper is now loaded only if the test suite actually asks for it.

## [1.59.22] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed

- The shared auth-failure cooldown now remembers a refused credential for
  longer than the slowest background check's cadence. Before, a checker that
  asked less often than the first cooldown window found nothing recorded on its
  next visit, started the window over, and so re-sent the refused request on
  every pass; on Kraken that kept the connection in a temporary lockout. A
  refused key now backs off to the hourly
  re-probe as intended.

## [1.59.21] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- Kraken's wording for a rejected API key is now recognised as a permanent key
  problem rather than a temporary glitch. Until now every background check kept
  re-sending the same request on a Kraken connection the exchange had already
  refused. Kraken answers repeated refused logins with a temporary lockout, so
  an unusable connection kept re-triggering it. A refused Kraken key now
  goes on the same cooldown every other exchange already uses: re-checked after
  five minutes, then progressively less often, and picked up right away once the
  key is fixed.

## [1.59.20] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- A deal close that the exchange would reject as too small is now reported to
  you the first time it happens. The warning was held back until the same
  refusal had been seen five times in a row within one bot process, counted in
  memory - but the refusal is re-checked when a bot worker starts, not
  continuously, so the count was reset before it could ever be reached and the
  message never arrived. Repeats are now spaced out by the same per-bot cooldown
  every other bot notification uses, which survives a restart.
- The quantity named in that warning could be shown as a negative number on a
  deal whose recorded closes exceed its recorded size. It is now reported as
  zero, which is what the deal actually holds. Only the wording changed - the
  decision to refuse was always made on the correct value.
- A spot deal whose asset has left the account is now settled instead of
  retrying a close forever. The check that settles a deal once the exchange no
  longer holds its position existed for futures only, because spot has no
  position to ask about; it now reads the account balance instead, and closes
  the deal - keeping the profit it had already realised - only when the account
  holds less of the asset than the pair's minimum order size, and only after two
  readings agree. An exchange that does not answer never settles a deal.

## [1.59.19] - 2026-09-15

### Fixed

- A deal left in "start" that the exchange never accepted an entry order for is
  now cancelled by the hourly sweep instead of being retried forever. The sweep
  asked the running bot to close the deal, and a bot that no longer held that
  deal in memory could only answer with a log line - so the deal stayed listed
  as starting, could not be closed from the dashboard, and was re-attempted
  every hour. The close now falls back to the stored deal, and cancels it only
  when every one of its orders is still without an exchange id, so nothing
  resting on an exchange can be abandoned.

## [1.59.18] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed

- A grid bot's closing result now reaches the account profit statistics. Profit
  from each completed grid round-trip was recorded there, but the profit or loss
  realized when the bot closed its remaining position was only written to the
  bot itself — so a bot that ended in the red kept its round-trip gains in the
  statistics and dropped the closing loss. Both the futures position close and
  the spot stop fill now record that result once, against the hour of the
  closing fill. Statistics from before this change are unaffected.

## [1.59.17] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed

- A bot's realized profit is no longer reset to zero by a restart that follows a
  failed profit calculation. The bot's cached snapshot stored the invalid figure
  as empty, and restoring it made the bot count its profit from scratch; such a
  snapshot is now ignored and the bot loads its last saved figures instead.

## [1.59.16] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- Counting the bots attached to a global variable no longer reads every bot
  record. The lookup filters on the variable list, which carried no index, so
  each count scanned a whole bot collection — and it runs once per variable on
  the bot every time a bot is created, saved, cloned or deleted. The variable
  list is now indexed on all three bot collections.

## [1.59.15] - 2026-09-13

### Fixed

- A DCA deal whose close would sit under the exchange's minimum order value is
  now closed whenever the venue's own rules allow it, instead of being refused
  every time. The check that decided this compared the minimum against the
  already fee-netted, step-rounded close size rather than against the quantity
  the deal holds, and on a long that comparison could only ever refuse — so a
  position large enough to close was left with no close order at all, retrying
  quietly. The close is now sized to the smallest quantity that meets the
  minimum and never more than the deal owns; where no quantity can reach it,
  the take profit rests at the lowest price the exchange will accept, bounded
  to an order of magnitude from the market. A position that genuinely cannot be
  closed at any allowed size now raises a visible warning on the bot instead of
  failing in silence. Stop losses are never re-priced above the market, and the
  guards that refuse a zero or far-from-market close price are unchanged.

## [1.59.14] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- A deal closed by the trailing take profit is recorded as closed by the
  trailing take profit again, instead of being recorded as a stop loss. The
  check that decides which trigger closed the deal tested the multi take
  profit target *list* rather than the multi take profit toggle, and that list
  is always present (empty when unused), so the trailing take-profit branch
  could never be taken. Bots with stop loss switched off showed profitable
  trailing exits labelled "stop loss", and per-trigger statistics counted them
  as stop losses. A deal closed at a real stop-loss level is still recorded as
  a stop loss, including on bots that also offer trailing take profit but have
  not armed it. Deals already closed keep the trigger they were stamped with.

## [1.59.13] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- A deal closed by a liquidation that took several positions at once now
  records its closing order. Some exchanges close every position in one
  liquidation under a single client order id, and only one order can be stored
  under a given id, so linking each deal by that id alone moved that one order
  from deal to deal: the last deal kept it and the others were left showing
  only their entry orders, with no closing trade and no close marker on the
  chart. Each deal is now given its own record of the liquidation unless the
  stored one is the bot's own, for that bot and that pair.

## [1.59.12] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Dismissing a hedge bot's error/warning banner now clears the flag on both
  legs when the dashboard names them with the hedge bot type
  (`hedgeCombo`/`hedgeDca`). Those types were looked up among grid bots, where
  a leg never matches, so the banner came back on the next load. The flag is
  now cleared in the combo or DCA bots the legs belong to. The mutation also
  answers only once the flag has been saved, and reports an error if saving
  fails, instead of reporting success before anything was written.

## [1.59.11] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- A futures bot started right after the opposite-side bot on the same symbol
  was stopped with a market close is no longer refused because that position is
  still closing. On a one-way account the exchange keeps one net position per
  symbol, so a long/short flip — for example one TradingView signal that stops
  the short bot and starts the long bot — reached the start check while the
  close was still being filled. The start was refused with "Side in active
  position is SHORT, but bot will open LONG", and the position was gone a
  second later. The start now looks at the position again for up to 10 seconds
  before refusing; if a position on the other side is really still open, the
  bot is refused exactly as before. Bots restarting with the service, and bots
  that already have active deals, are unaffected.

## [1.59.10] - 2026-09-11

### Fixed

- A futures deal closed by an exchange liquidation now shows the closing order.
  The liquidation is recorded against the bot, but it was stored without the
  deal it belonged to, and everything the deal view reads is looked up by deal
  — so the deal's order history listed only the orders that opened the
  position, and its chart drew no closing marker. A deal that ended at a loss
  therefore offered nothing that said why, which reads as though it had been
  closed for no reason. The liquidation is now linked to the deal (or deals) it
  closed, so it appears in the history and on the chart at the price the
  position went away at. It is recorded as a link only: nothing about how or
  when a position is liquidated changes, and the deal's profit, average price
  and volume are unaffected.

## [1.59.9] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- A DCA deal could be left in the starting state holding no order at all. The
  deal record is written before the entry order it exists to hold is built, and
  building that order can fail — an order sized as a percentage of the account
  balance cannot be built when the exchange refuses to report the balance, which
  is what happens while an API key is expired, revoked or blocked by an IP
  restriction. The reason was reported, but the deal record was left behind: it
  showed no cost and no average price, its actions menu was unavailable because
  the deal had never opened, and it still counted towards the bot's limit on
  active deals — so a bot could gradually fill up with deals that had never
  placed anything and then stop opening new ones. A deal whose entry order
  cannot be built and which holds no order of any kind is now cancelled instead
  of being left behind, so the active-deal count keeps reflecting only deals
  that really exist. Deals already left in that state are cleared the next time
  the bot starts. A deal holding any order at all — resting, cancelled or partly
  filled — is never touched by this, and the reason the entry could not be built
  is still reported exactly as before.

## [1.59.8] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- A DCA deal whose base order was only partly filled by the time its entry
  timers ran out could stay in the starting state indefinitely. The engine
  checks the entry once more when the timer for entering at market price
  expires, but a partly filled order was treated as nothing to act on — so that
  check cleared the deal's remaining timer and stopped. The deal was left
  showing no cost and no average price, with its actions menu unavailable, while
  the quantity already bought sat on the exchange with no take profit and no
  stop loss and the deal held one of the bot's active slots. A partly filled
  entry that nothing else is scheduled to look at again now has its unfilled
  remainder cancelled and opens the deal on the quantity that actually executed,
  so average price, cost, usage and the closing orders are all derived from the
  real position. Deals already left in that state are recovered the next time
  the bot starts. Repositioning is unchanged: while the enter-at-market check is
  still pending, a partly filled entry is left to carry on filling.

## [1.59.7] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- The protections added in the previous release for a closing order priced far
  from the market covered a deal closing with a single order, but not a deal
  closing through a take-profit or stop-loss ladder. A ladder builds each of its
  steps from the deal's average entry price by the same sequence, so when that
  price was unavailable a ladder step could still be turned into a well-formed
  but badly wrong price: the rule meant to nudge a step one tick off the entry
  price treated the missing price as an ordinary value, and a second rule then
  raised the result to whatever cleared the exchange's minimum order value. That
  same minimum-order rule could also inflate a legitimately priced ladder step
  whose size fell below the minimum, leaving a closing order resting above the
  price the trader actually asked for. Ladder steps are now refused when the
  price they derive from is unusable, they reach the exchange's minimum by
  adjusting size rather than price and never for more than the deal holds, and
  every closing order — single or laddered — is checked against the live market
  before it is placed.

## [1.59.6] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- A DCA deal could be left holding a funded position with no take-profit order
  covering it. When sizing a closing order, the bot adds up how much each of the
  deal's own orders actually filled. If one of those records arrived from the
  exchange without a readable filled amount, the addition produced "not a
  number" rather than skipping that record, and every later step passed the
  result along unchanged — including the checks meant to catch an impossible
  quantity, which cannot compare against a value that is not a number. The
  closing order was then refused as unusable, so nothing was placed and the
  position rested unprotected until the deal was closed by hand. A record whose
  filled amount cannot be read now counts as zero, matching how the rest of the
  deal-coverage code already reads the same field, and the remainder is
  recovered from the deal's own recorded position — so the closing order is
  placed at the correct quantity.

## [1.59.5] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- When the price feed was briefly unavailable, a deal closing at that moment
  could place its closing order at a small fraction of the market price. The
  closing price is derived from the deal's average entry price, so when that
  arrived as zero the result was zero too. A rule meant to nudge a closing
  price one tick off the entry price — there to break a tie between two
  legitimate prices — treated that zero as an ordinary value and turned it into
  one tick, and the existing check that rejects a closing price of zero ran
  later in the sequence and so never saw it. A second rule, which lifts an
  order up to the exchange's minimum order value, then raised that tick to a
  price the exchange would accept. A closing price that cannot be derived is
  now refused before either rule can rewrite it, the minimum-order-value rule
  adjusts quantity rather than price, and a closing order priced far enough
  from the market to give away value is refused outright.

## [1.59.4] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- On OKX, roughly one DCA safety order in sixty was recorded as though the user
  had added funds to the deal by hand. The two are told apart by a marker in the
  order id, and OKX order ids are built without separators, which makes a safety
  order whose random part happens to begin with the right letter identical to an
  addition. The deal then gained an entry it never took, its level count grew,
  its running record of what it had bought was not updated for that fill, and no
  safety-order notification was sent for it. Orders are now told apart by the
  field that records the addition itself, which no venue's id format can blur.
  Deals affected in the past keep the extra entry in their history; the fix
  stops new ones.
- A deal whose safety orders fire on indicator signals no longer reports that it
  will never spend again after enough funds have been added to it by hand. Its
  maximum-usage figure was capped once two internal level counts met, and adding
  funds moved one of them without moving the other, so on that type of bot three
  additions were enough to cap a deal that had not fired a single safety order.
  The figure now follows the levels the bot was actually configured with.

## [1.59.3] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- The safety-order-filled notification named the wrong order number on a deal
  that had taken add funds. The number came from the counter an addition also
  increments, so each top-up shifted every later notification by one — a deal
  with one addition announced its first safety order as "safety order 2". It is
  now derived from the configured ladder, which subtracts those additions back
  out.

## [1.59.2] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- On a DCA bot whose safety orders fire on indicator signals, adding funds to an
  open deal no longer moves the deal past the signal it is waiting for. Each
  configured indicator is one level of the ladder, and an addition was counted
  as if a level had been taken: the signal the deal was due stopped matching it
  and never fired again, and the next signal to arrive bought a deeper level
  early, at that level's size. Deals already in that state start answering the
  right signal again as soon as the fix is running — nothing to re-run.

## [1.59.1] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- Adding funds to an open DCA deal no longer cancels the deal's next safety
  order. An addition is an entry outside the configured ladder, not one of its
  levels, so the ladder now keeps every level it was configured with, at its
  original prices. The same correction keeps "execute next DCA order" aimed at
  the next unused ladder level on a deal that has taken added funds.

## [1.59.0] - 2026-09-10

### Added

- The bot engine now reports a filled safety order to the notification layer,
  with the number of the level that filled and how many the deal has in total.
  Previously only the base order, the 80% and 100% ladder marks and the close
  were reported, so a deal working its way down its ladder produced nothing in
  between. Applies to DCA and combo bots, including their hedge counterparts.

## [1.58.24] - 2026-09-10

### Fixed

- A request to close or cancel a deal is no longer reported as done when the engine never acted on it. The close is handed to the bot in the background and answered immediately, so a request the bot could not match to a deal it was tracking was dropped with nothing but an internal log line, while the deal stayed open — and the person who made the request was told it had worked. Believing the position closed, they could sell it by hand at the exchange, or walk away from a position that is in fact still live and still being managed. When the deal record still shows the deal as open, the dropped request is now raised as a warning on the bot, naming the deal and its pair and asking for the close to be tried again. A request for a deal that had already finished closing stays quiet as before — that is a duplicate, not a failure — and the new check only reads the deal, never writes to it, so deals that already closed are left untouched. A dropped request is raised as a warning rather than an error: the bot itself is healthy and is not put into an error state.
- The event-log line saying a deal was "closed manually" was written the instant the close was handed off rather than when it completed, so it recorded closes that never happened — and it was the record used to confirm one had. It has been removed; the event written when a close genuinely completes, and the one written when a deal is abandoned with volume still on the exchange, are unchanged.

## [1.58.23] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- A deal's running record of what it has bought and sold no longer counts orders that never traded. Two kinds of row were being read as if they had filled: an order that was cancelled before it was ever sent to the exchange, which is stored with its planned size already written into the filled-quantity field, and an order that states it filled nothing, which was counted at the size it was planned for instead of at zero. Both add coin the deal does not hold to its record. That mattered most when a deal closed: the leftover is valued at the closing price and booked as profit, so a deal could report a gain many times its configured take-profit target while the account balance never moved — and the same overstated holding is what sizes the closing order, so the exchange rejects it for insufficient balance and the deal closes on whatever it could actually sell. A genuine partial fill on a cancelled order still counts in full, and a deal whose record already matched its trades is unchanged to the last decimal. Spec 029.

## [1.58.22] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- An exchange answer that reports an order as complete while stating nothing at all about a trade — no filled quantity, no filled value, no fill time and no trade records — is no longer taken as proof that the order filled. Such an answer used to be copied over the order wholesale, which made a resting order permanently complete even though it was still sitting on the exchange, and replaced its price with zero. For a take-profit that meant the deal was closed on a sale that never happened: the quantity it was closed on could not be resolved to a number, so the deal record was rejected on save and only the order's change survived. The result was a position with its close order marked complete, the deal still open, and nothing left working to close it — a state nothing else can recover from, and one that leaves no trace in the logs because that write path was never narrated. The order now keeps the state we already have, keeps being re-checked so the next answer can resolve it properly, and the refusal is reported. A quantity or value the exchange does not state no longer erases the one already recorded, and an unresolvable price falls back to the order's own price instead of zero.
- A deal is no longer closed on a take-profit that sold nothing. A close whose resolved quantity is zero, or cannot be resolved to a number at all, is refused and reported, and the deal is left open holding its position — where the existing take-profit coverage check can see it and re-arm it — instead of being half-closed with the order marked complete and the deal left open with no orders resting. Spec 028.

## [1.58.21] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- A combo bot with the fee-order setting on no longer asks the exchange to sell more of the traded coin than it holds when it closes a deal. When that setting is on, the bot buys a little extra of the coin so the exchange's fee can be paid without eating into the position, and the leftover is deliberately sold in the same order as the position when the deal closes — otherwise it is stranded, and on a pair with a large minimum order size it can never be sold at all. How much is left over is remembered as a running figure on the deal. A deal could inherit that figure without ever having bought any extra itself, and then add it to its closing order, asking the exchange for coins the account had never purchased. The exchange refuses the order, and because every figure behind the size is stored rather than recalculated, the identical order goes out again on the next check — a deal in that state can never close by itself and has to be closed by hand. The leftover is now capped at what the deal's own fee purchases actually bought: a deal that bought extra still sells it along with the position, and a deal that bought none closes at exactly what it holds.

## [1.58.20] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- A closing order that Kraken or Hyperliquid refuses for lack of funds is now recognised as a funding problem rather than a general failure. The engine decides that a refusal means "the account could not pay for this" by matching the exchange's own wording against a list of known phrasings, and four behaviours hang off that decision: the plain-language "not enough balance" message shown on the bot, the pause that stops an unaffordable order being re-sent on every check, the retry that re-sizes a close when the fee was taken in the coin being sold, and the optional Adaptive Close setting. Kraken and Hyperliquid each word their refusal in a way that matched none of the known phrasings, so on those two exchanges none of the four ever ran: the refusal was reported as an ordinary bot error, a fresh alert was raised each time, and the same unaffordable order went out again on the next check with nothing to slow it down. A bot in that state could spend a long time failing to close a deal while appearing to try. Both wordings are now recognised, and a test holds the list to each exchange's specific phrasing so that a broad, over-eager match cannot be introduced later.
- Adaptive Close now applies to spot bots only. It re-sizes a refused closing order to the amount of the traded coin sitting free in the wallet, which is the quantity that can actually be sold on a spot account. A futures wallet holds collateral rather than the coin, so on most futures accounts the lookup simply found nothing and the setting did nothing; on inverse (coin-margined) accounts, where the wallet is denominated in the coin itself, it could instead have matched a margin balance against a position size measured in contracts and placed a close smaller than the position, leaving the remainder open on the exchange. Spot bots are unchanged.

## [1.58.19] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- A deal that stays open because its close order only partly filled no longer has its remaining safety orders withdrawn. When an exchange reports a close order as complete, the deal is treated as finished and any orders still resting for it are pulled. Some exchanges report a close as complete while having sold only a fraction of what was asked; the engine already refuses to finish a deal on such a report, but the separate step that withdraws the resting orders did not apply that same test — so on a single pass the deal was correctly kept open while the safety orders averaging its position were cancelled. That leaves a live position with no close order and no safety orders resting, and nothing on screen marks a deal in that state, so it can persist unnoticed. Both steps now use the same test. A close order that genuinely filled in full still finishes the deal and pulls its resting orders, and a deal already recorded as finished is unaffected. Spec 027.

## [1.58.18] - 2026-09-09

### Fixed

- A Hyperliquid deal whose fees were charged in a third asset can now place its take-profit again. Such a deal first tries the close at a size that leaves the fee out, and that attempt is tagged so the two tries can be told apart afterwards. On Hyperliquid the tag becomes part of the order's own identifier, and that exchange requires the identifier to be built only from the digits 0-9 and the letters a-f — the tag used two characters outside that set, so the exchange refused to read the request at all and answered that it could not interpret it. No close order was placed, and the attempt repeated on every later check. Tags are now kept to characters the identifier allows, in one place, and a test rejects any future tag that steps outside them. Deals on every other exchange, and Hyperliquid deals that never take this branch, are unchanged.

## [1.58.17] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- A deal that has already taken part of its profit no longer arms a replacement close order for more than it holds. The size of a close is worked out from the volume the deal bought, less whatever it has already sold. The record of what the deal bought never had the sold amount taken out of it in the first place, so adding that amount back on top inflated the figure by exactly what had been sold; the resulting close order asks the exchange for coins the deal no longer owns and is rejected, and each rejection leaves the position with no exit order resting at all. Funds deliberately withdrawn from a deal are a different case and are still added back, because those genuinely do leave the recorded volume. A deal that has sold nothing is unchanged to the last decimal. Spec 026.
- Cancelling a partly-filled order in order to REPLACE it with a bigger one is now always recorded as a cancellation. Some exchanges answer such a cancellation by reporting the order as complete, and that answer was written over the local record before the "this is a replacement, not a close" instruction was read — so the instruction was skipped, the partial sale was recorded as if the whole order had filled, and the deal's own figures stopped matching the position it still held. The exchange's report of how much actually traded is still kept, and an order the exchange fills outright in the moment before the cancellation lands is still recorded as filled. Spec 026.

## [1.58.16] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- An order whose quantity or price is not a real number is no longer sent to the exchange or recorded. Such an order can never be filled, but it was still written to the order history first, where the unusable value was kept as text — and every later calculation that read it back produced another unusable value, so the deal's own figures stopped being saved at all while the position stayed open with no exit order. Two places that could produce one are fixed at the source as well: the safety-order ladder now refuses to be built when the price it sizes against is missing, instead of quietly producing a ladder of unusable sizes, and the close order does the same when its size cannot be worked out after the fact. Healthy orders, ladders and close orders are unchanged to the last decimal. Spec 025.

## [1.58.15] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- Closing a deal no longer reports a loss the size of everything the deal was allowed to spend. A deal keeps a running tally of what it currently holds, and its realised result is that tally measured against the funds it started with. If the tally was lost — reset to zero, or left holding a value that is not a real number — the two cancelled out and the deal booked its whole allocation as a loss, which then carried into the bot's totals and the profit history. The tally can be lost because the working copy a bot restores itself from after a restart is stored as plain text, where a value that is not a real number becomes an empty one on the way in; the database refuses such a value outright and keeps the last good figures. Deal close now rebuilds the tally from the deal's own filled orders before working out any result, and says so in the bot log. A healthy deal's arithmetic is unchanged to the last decimal, and a restored copy whose tally is unusable is discarded in favour of the database copy — the same way an unusable average price already was. Spec 024.

## [1.58.14] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- A take-profit order is no longer built, sent or recorded when its size does not come out as a real number. If a deal's price inputs are momentarily missing, the size the close is derived from could become "not a number", and none of the existing minimum-size checks catch that value — every comparison against it is false — so the order was recorded and sent regardless. The venue refused it, but the recorded row kept the unusable size, and from then on the deal's own totals could not be saved at all, so its stored figures stopped following the position. Close orders now refuse to be built in that state and say so in the bot log, the same way adding funds to a deal already refuses an unusable quantity. Spec 023.

## [1.58.13] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- `deal.commission` no longer double-books a fee that was observed but paid in an off-pair asset (BNB/BGB/KCS-style, or a `PAPER_FEE_ASSET_SYMBOLS` test symbol). `getCommDeal` only checked whether an order's fee resolved to base/quote and applied the full flat-rate estimate whenever it didn't — indistinguishable from "nothing was observed at all." It now books 0 for an order whose fee WAS observed, just off-pair — the same rule `closeDeal`'s `feeByAsset` ledger and `getTPOrder`'s TP-sizing gate already apply (spec 014/015), applied unconditionally (not gated behind the `feeByAsset` deal flag — this is a correctness fix, not a new-deals-only feature). Spec 021.

### Added

- A deal's observed-fee ledger (`feeByAsset`) and the on-pair portion of `feePaid` now update after every fill — base order, each safety/DCA order, every partial or reduce-funds TP — instead of only once, retroactively, at close. Extracted the observed-only portion of `closeDeal`'s existing computation into `computeObservedFeeLedger`, called from `startDeal` and `updateDeal`; always recomputed fresh from every filled order rather than accumulated incrementally, so it's safe to call after every fill without double-counting — `closeDeal`'s own loop now seeds `feeByAsset` from empty for the same reason. Gated the same way the ledger already is (`DCADealFlags.feeByAsset`, new deals only); no change to what `closeDeal` computes or persists at close. Spec 022.

## [1.58.12] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- A closed DCA deal's off-pair fee ledger (`feeByAsset`) now actually reaches Mongo. `closeDeal` computes it correctly on every TP fill (spec 014 §2.1/§2.2), but the `saveDeal` call that persists the close passed an explicit field list that never included `feeByAsset` — `commission`/`profit`/`feePaid` were saved, the ledger itself wasn't, silently. Found live-testing spec 004's third-asset paper fee (`paper-trading-sh`): both `Order` documents carried a real `feeAsset`/`feePaid`, `getTPOrder` correctly skipped the TP gross-up for it, but the closed deal's `feeByAsset` stayed `[]`. The combo close path (`comboHelper.ts`) already saved this field correctly — the two were never in lockstep. Spec 020.

## [1.58.11] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- The live order-update stream now carries a paper deal's observed fee. `convertExecutionReportToOrder`'s stream merge copied `feePaid`/`feeAsset`/`feeBreakdown`/`feePaidUsd` from the incoming message but never `feeSide` — the one field paper-trading ever sets (it never sets `feeAsset`) — so a paper fill's fee silently fell back to the estimate on this path even after the venue reported it, while the REST-poll merge (`mergeCommonOrderWithOrder`) was unaffected. The four-field copy is now `streamFeeFields` (`src/bot/orderFee.ts`), a fifth field added alongside the other four. Spec 019; companion fixes in `paper-trading-sh` (spec 003) and `websocket-connector-sh` (spec 005) are required for the fee to actually reach this merge.

## [1.58.10] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- An exchange that refused an order because its quantity carried more decimal places than that account's venue accepts is now learned from instead of simply failing. A trading pair's quantity step is read once from the exchange's public instrument list and shared by every bot on that pair, but the endpoint an account actually trades against does not always publish the same limits — a regional endpoint can require a coarser quantity, and may not list the pair at all — so every order the bot computed was refused, again and again, with no refresh able to fix it. The refusal itself now supplies the answer: a quantity the venue rejects proves it accepts one decimal place fewer, so the order is rounded down to that and sent again immediately, and the precision is remembered for that connection and pair so later orders are sized correctly from the start rather than costing another refusal. The remembered value can only ever get coarser, is never applied to any other account, and never changes the shared pair record. An account that has never been refused behaves exactly as before.

## [1.58.9] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- A deal could rest a take-profit sized for its opening order alone while it actually held everything its safety orders had bought, so the position could not close at target and the money kept riding with no exit order covering it. The close is sized by adding up the deal's entry orders as the running bot holds them in memory, and that record is rebuilt whenever a worker restarts; when safety-order rows were missing from it the sum silently collapsed to the opening order, and nothing compared the result against the position the deal itself records. Deals whose opening order was the missing row were already covered by an earlier fix; the same check now applies when the opening order is present, so the quantity can only ever be raised to the position the deal records, never lowered below the order on record. A deal whose records all agree is unaffected. The log now says when the position, rather than the order row, supplied the size.
- The take-profit coverage correction now also repairs a deal resting a single take-profit that is simply too small. It could previously only act on a deal whose take-profit had taken a partial fill, or one with no take-profit at all, so an undersized-but-untouched order was reported on every pass and never corrected. Correcting one asks the engine to resize it, which is the path that already cancels the small order and sends the replacement in the same pass. A deal offering more than it owns is unchanged and is still never added to.

## [1.58.8] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- The take-profit coverage correction can now be armed for named deals rather than only all-or-nothing. That correction cancels a stale take-profit and places a replacement with real money, so it stays off unless an operator turns it on — but the only value that turned it on applied to every affected deal at once, leaving no way to try it on a single deal and read the result before widening. `BOT_TP_COVERAGE_REPAIR` now also accepts a comma-separated list of deal ids and corrects only those; `1`/`true`/`yes` keeps its existing meaning of every affected deal, and leaving it unset still changes nothing at all. A value that is neither is refused rather than guessed at — nothing is corrected, and the reason is logged, instead of the setting appearing to have been ignored. The scope the engine actually read is written to the log once at startup so it can be confirmed. Deals outside an armed scope are still detected and reported exactly as before, and now say they were skipped for that reason rather than reporting as though the correction were switched off entirely.

## [1.58.7] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- A bot running several contracts at once could stop recording its error messages for the rest of an hour. Repeating errors are grouped into one row per bot per time window, so a standing problem counts up instead of flooding the list, and that row also names the contract the problem happened on. The contract is part of the row's identity in the database, so rewriting it on every occurrence moved the row — and when a multi-contract bot's legs had each opened a row in the same window, which they can do at the same instant, the move landed on top of the sibling row and was rejected. It was rejected on the retry too, so the occurrence was recorded nowhere and only a warning was logged; roughly half of the window's errors were lost this way, the half belonging to whichever contract the group had not settled on. The contract is now recorded once, when the row is opened, so the row never moves and every occurrence is counted. As a side effect the row no longer silently re-labels itself as other contracts fail — it names the contract the window opened on and keeps it. Errors that are genuinely per-contract, such as an exchange agreement that has to be signed for each contract separately, are unaffected: they already keep one row per contract.

## [1.58.6] - 2026-09-08

### Fixed

- Orders refused by one of the bot's own local guards (not enough balance, compliance restriction, exchange auth cooldown) are no longer left behind as open orders. The engine saves an order to the database just before sending it, as a safety record in case the process dies mid-placement; when a local guard then refuses the order the exchange never sees it, but since 2026-08-06 that safety record was neither completed nor removed, so it stayed on the books as a live order the exchange had never heard of. Affected bots showed a growing list of open orders that could not be cancelled or filled, and each one was re-adopted by the bot every time it restarted. The record is now removed on that path, and only for orders still carrying the unsent placeholder — anything the exchange has acknowledged, or that has already filled or cancelled, is left exactly as it was.

## [1.58.5] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- The take-profit coverage check reported healthy deals as drifted by exactly the trading fee. A take-profit is deliberately not sized at the position it closes: on spot it is shaved by one fee on a long, and grossed up by one on a short, because the close itself is charged in the base asset. The check compared the resting take-profit against the position instead, so a spot deal large enough for one fee to clear the venue's minimum order size was reported as under- or over-covered on every reconcile pass and could never clear. It now ignores a difference no larger than the fee the take-profit is sized net of, and judges only what remains — the part a repair would actually have to place an order for. Detection only: nothing is cancelled, placed or re-armed as a result, futures deals are unaffected (their take-profit carries no fee), and a genuine coverage gap still reports exactly as before.

## [1.58.4] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- Hyperliquid bots (spot and perpetuals, including builder-dex markets such as `xyz:NVDA-USDC`) never received live price ticks. The bot subscribed to its price channel by Hyperliquid's wire code while the price stream publishes by display pair, so the channel it listened on had no publisher and every price-triggered check ran on the REST fallback's cadence instead of per tick. The bot now subscribes by display pair, as the candle channel already did. Paper Hyperliquid bots were not affected.
- Paper Bitget spot bots never received live price ticks either: the paper-to-real exchange mapping had no entry for paper Bitget spot, so the bot listened on a paper-named price channel nothing publishes to (its cached-price lookups were keyed the same way). Paper Bitget spot now maps to Bitget like every other paper variant.

## [1.58.3] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- The "Live price stream resumed" bot log (1.57.19) could fire one poll early on a DCA bot with more than one open deal on the same symbol. The poll walks deals, and told the stream-health tracker about the symbol once per deal; the tracker's rule that a symbol fresh right after our own REST injection is not yet proof of a live tick only holds for one observation per poll, so the second deal's observation was read as that proof. Each poll now reports each symbol once. No trading behaviour changes.

## [1.58.2] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- The "No live price stream" bot log (1.57.19) fired for every symbol on every bot load. A freshly loaded bot has no stream data for any of its symbols yet, and its subscriptions settle over the following minutes, so the first price poll flagged them all and two polls later declared them all recovered — a burst of lines per worker restart that said nothing about the stream. A bot now gives its symbols a short grace after loading (twice the poll interval) before reporting one as gapped, unless it has already seen a live tick for that symbol, in which case a later gap is reported at once. A symbol that still has not ticked when the grace ends is reported as before, dated from its first stale poll, and a gap that was never reported does not report its recovery either.

## [1.58.1] - 2026-09-07

### Changed

- `POST /api/v2/backtest/{botType}/request/sync` now keeps its connection alive while it waits. That wait is by design up to an hour, and a proxy or CDN in front of the API will not sit through it in silence — many give up at about 100 seconds — so the caller lost a response for a backtest that was still running fine. Existing clients are unaffected: the JSON response is byte-compatible, the heartbeat being insignificant whitespace ahead of the document. Callers who send `Accept: text/event-stream` instead get the same result as Server-Sent Events, with the request id delivered up front, before the wait — so if the connection does drop, the run can still be collected from `GET /api/v2/backtest/{botType}/requests/{id}`.

## [1.58.0] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- Execute a DCA deal's next safety order on demand, at market, instead of waiting for price (or its indicator signal) to reach it. The deal books it as that level and carries on with the next one at its original price — unlike Add funds, which adds size outside the ladder and does not consume a level. Only the next level can be executed: no skipping ahead, no reordering, no price editing. Available on DCA deals over GraphQL (`executeNextDca`) and the public API (`POST /api/v2/deals/dca/execute-next-dca`). Works for all three ladder shapes — percentage, custom and indicator-driven; combo and risk-based deals are excluded, because their levels are not ladder slots. Where the ladder rests on the venue, the resting order for that level is cancelled first, and the request is refused if that level fills on its own in the meantime. Requested by the community.

## [1.57.20] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- `npm run lint` failed on a clean checkout again, so husky's pre-commit hook rejected every commit in this repo and commits had to bypass it with `--no-verify`. The take-profit coverage harness (1.57.17) re-loads `dcaHelper` with a fresh module cache so each arming state of `BOT_TP_COVERAGE_REPAIR` gets its own build of the helper, and did so through a bare `require()`, which `@typescript-eslint/no-require-imports` forbids. The harness now goes through a dedicated `createRequire(__filename)` loader, which keeps the cache-busting re-import and satisfies the rule; the file was also brought in line with the repo's prettier settings. Test behaviour is unchanged.

## [1.57.19] - 2026-09-07

### Added

- Bot logs now say, once, when a symbol stops receiving live price ticks and falls back to the periodic REST price poll — and say so again when live ticks return. The poll is only a fallback for the `trade@` price stream, but it is also what drives every price-triggered decision (take-profit level check, stop loss, trailing, DCA level), so a symbol stuck on it evaluates those on a ~5-minute cadence instead of per tick. That state was previously visible only at debug level, which is off by default, so an exchange whose price stream was never enabled looked from the bot's side exactly like a quiet market.

## [1.57.18] - 2026-09-07

### Fixed

- A DCA deal whose base order is refused because the venue's book is in limit-only mode is no longer left with no order on the exchange at all. The limit fallback used to require the bot to be configured for LIMIT entry, so a MARKET-entry bot — whose base order is a market order from the outset — still fell through to the generic error handler and sat in `start` with nothing on the book. The fallback now re-sends the base order with an explicit force-limit flag, which covers both entry types and still terminates after exactly one re-send.

## [1.57.17] - 2026-09-06

### Added

- DCA deals are now checked, on each reconcile pass, that their resting take-profit still covers the position the deal is tracking. Deals whose take-profit stopped covering their position before 1.57.15 shipped stayed that way, because coverage is only ever re-established when a safety order fills — a market event that may never arrive. Several deals were sitting like that: some carrying no take-profit at all, others resting a duplicate take-profit that offered more base than the deal owned. The check reports each such deal once; the correction that cancels the stale take-profit and re-arms it is opt-in, behind BOT_TP_COVERAGE_REPAIR, since it cancels and places real orders.

## [1.57.16] - 2026-09-06

### Fixed

- A DCA take-profit that is cancelled only in order to re-size it is no longer reported as a completed take-profit. The opt-out added in 1.57.15 was passed as a condition on the engine's own copy of the resting order, read before the cancel; the exchange's reply to that cancel then overwrites the very field the condition tested, so whenever the engine's copy had fallen behind the exchange — after a restart, or on a venue that does not report partial fills — the deal was closed on whatever fraction had sold and the untouched remainder of the position was immediately market-sold below the take-profit price. The cancel now always states its intent, so a re-size can never close a deal.

## [1.57.15] - 2026-09-06

### Fixed

- A DCA deal whose take-profit had already sold part of the position could no longer arm a new take-profit. When a safety order fills the engine re-sizes the take-profit, and the check for "does this deal already have one resting?" only looked at orders with status NEW — which is exactly the status a partially-filled take-profit no longer has. Nothing cancelled it, the replacement was sent on top of a live order, and the venue refused it for the amount that order was still holding: the deal was left with a take-profit sized for an older, smaller position and no way to close at its target. The lookup now also sees PARTIALLY_FILLED take-profits, compares the replacement against what the resting order can still sell rather than the size it was created for, and cancels it before placing the replacement. `cancelOrderOnExchange` gained an opt-out (`promotePartialToFilled`, default unchanged) so that this one re-size cancel is not mistaken for a completed take-profit and does not close the deal on the fraction that happened to have sold.

## [1.57.14] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- The reconcile pass's "could not read N order(s)" warning now reports how many exchange lookups it actually spent instead of the configured per-order retry budget. The budget was printed unconditionally, so the line always read "after 3 attempts" even when every order was answered on the first look and the retry ladder never ran — which is the usual case, because a definitive "no such order" from the exchange stops the ladder immediately. Reading that number as work performed makes a quiet pass look like a retry storm, and it already cost time investigating a code path that was behaving correctly. The line now names the lookups spent and the budget separately. Log wording only: reconcile does exactly the same work, in the same order, as before.

## [1.57.13] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- Cancelling an order that never reached the exchange no longer asks the exchange about it. On Kraken spot, Coinbase and KuCoin futures an order is addressed by the exchange's own order id, and an order the exchange refused at placement has none — the cancel sent the placeholder "-1" instead, spending a rate-limited private call to be told, correctly, that no such order exists. The order is now retired straight away from what Gainium already knows, exactly as the order-lookup path has done since August. If that wasted call happened to time out, the bot was also put into an error state over an order that had never existed, and the stale order stayed on the books until the next attempt; neither can happen now. Every other exchange, and any order that does hold a real exchange order id, is unaffected.

## [1.57.12] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- Kraken spot orders are now given a client order id Kraken itself can carry. Kraken accepts a client order id only as a UUID or as free text of at most 18 characters, and Gainium's was 35, so the exchange connector had to hash it before sending — which worked, but meant the id shown on the order was not the id Kraken knew it by, and anyone looking at the order on Kraken had no way back to the Gainium order. Kraken spot ids are now generated inside that 18-character budget and are sent through untouched. Orders placed before this change are unaffected and keep resolving the way they always did; every other exchange keeps the id it has today.

## [1.57.11] - 2026-09-05

### Fixed

- A DCA deal with several take-profit targets now closes when its position is fully sold, instead of waiting for targets it could never fill. When a target's share of the position is smaller than the exchange's minimum order size the engine rounds it up, so a position only a couple of steps wide is exhausted by the first one or two targets — after which the deal stayed open indefinitely, re-sending take-profit orders the exchange rejects, with its funds still counted as in use.

## [1.57.10] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- A bot that cannot afford to start a new deal now says so once, instead of once a minute for as long as the shortfall lasts. The balance check runs on a loop and the account behind it does not change between runs, but every refusal was recorded as a fresh warning — so a bot's event history filled with hundreds of identical entries a day and real events were buried. This one warning accounted for the majority of all bot events written in a day, across a large number of bots. The shortfall is now reported when it starts, again if it clears and comes back, and once a day while it persists. Terminal deals are unaffected and still report every time. Applies to DCA and Combo bots.
- `Deal symbol <X> not in pairs` moved from the error log to debug — the same loop subscribes the symbol immediately afterwards, so it was never a condition anyone could act on.

## [1.57.9] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- A bot blocked on several contracts at once now gets a message for each of them. When an exchange refuses an order until the user signs that contract's agreement, the refusal was recorded against the bot rather than against the contract: every blocked contract shared one notification row, whose pair name was overwritten by whichever contract failed most recently, and only the very first one was ever announced. A single bot could be refused on many different contracts at once, with the refusal windows overlapping, and the user was told about one. Each contract now gets its own message and its own notification, while conditions that belong to the bot or the account (a rejected API key, a plan limit) keep the single message per bot they had.

## [1.57.8] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- A bot's Buy & Hold comparison no longer reads −100% when its reference pair cannot be priced. The comparison is pinned to the pair the bot started on, and that pair can later be delisted and dropped from the bot's settings; the price lookup then failed and the failure was used as if it were a price of zero — so the ratio showed a total loss and the benchmark line on the equity chart sat flat at zero, while the bot kept asking the exchange for the delisted pair and logging the rejection on every stats update. The last valid comparison is now kept until the pair can be priced again.

## [1.57.7] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Deals no longer stay open forever against a position the exchange no longer holds. When a take profit is reached and the closing order cannot be placed, the bot now asks the exchange whether the position is still there; if it is not, the deal is closed with the profit it had already realised and a message explaining why, instead of re-arming the same impossible close on every price update. Deals were found that had been open for months, re-trying roughly every 15 seconds against positions the exchange closed the day they opened. The check is throttled to one lookup per deal per 5 minutes, only applies to futures deals, and never closes a deal when the exchange could not be reached.

## [1.57.6] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Market take profit: when the exchange refuses the closing order because the position is not there to reduce (`Reduce order is rejected`, `ReduceOnly Order`, `current position is zero…`), the deal now backs off instead of re-sending the identical order on every price update, and says so on the deal. The refusal was discarded unread — it was logged only as `not placed` — so every outcome was treated as a transient miss and re-armed against the price tick: a single deal could re-send one client order id hundreds of times in a couple of hours and the user was told nothing, because that rejection class is deliberately invisible at bot level. Retries now wait 1 → 2 → 4 → 8 → 15 minutes, an accepted close clears the wait immediately, and genuinely transient outcomes keep retrying at once as before.

## [1.57.5] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Bot messages named the wrong pair. Grid bots store `settings.pair` as a plain string while DCA/combo bots store an array, and the message writer indexed `[0]` unconditionally — so every grid bot's notification reported the first *character* of its pair (`TONUSDT` shown as `T`) across all error types. Many records across a large number of grid bots carry a one-letter pair, a good share of them still live and visible today. Separately, `getLatestPrice()` did not pass the pair it had just failed on, so the message fell back to the bot's first configured pair: a multi-pair bot filed every one of its "Not supported symbols" occurrences against `BTCUSDT`, a pair the venue does list, hiding the pair that actually failed.

## [1.57.4] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Bot stats: a deal canceled before its base order filled no longer stops a bot from saving its statistics. Such a deal carries no price at all, and the stats seed divided by it — producing `NaN` for the USD start balance on spot bots and pinning the buy & hold reference price to 0 for the rest of the bot's life. Mongo rejected the whole stats write on that `NaN`, so profit, drawdown, per-pair figures and the equity chart silently stopped updating. The seed now ignores a priceless deal, an already-zeroed buy & hold reference re-seeds itself from the next real deal, and a chart point that was poisoned before this fix heals instead of carrying the bad value forward.

## [1.57.3] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Bot messaging: a `userStream` service restart no longer records `No exchange data in connect rabbit undefined` against bots that have no exchange connection loaded. The restart broadcast reaches every bot instance in a worker and `connectRabbitUserStream` ran unguarded, so a bot still loading — or an archived one whose instance was never unsubscribed — looked up an `undefined` connection and logged the failure with an empty `userId`, leaving the record impossible to attribute to a user. It now returns early exactly as `resubscribeUserStream` already did; a bot that is still loading connects when its load finishes.

## [1.57.2] - 2026-09-04

### Fixed

- Multi take-profit: a target that fires but books no new fill no longer strands the deal. `checkTPLevel` set `closeByTp` before sending the market close and only the fill-processing paths ever cleared it, so an attempt that placed nothing — no exchange info, a send that failed, or a re-send of a target that had already filled and came back "already processed" — latched the flag true. While latched, every later price tick skipped the deal ("already closing by TP") and every deal-settings edit was refused ("closing by TP. Skip place orders"), so the remaining targets could not arm until an unrelated fill or a worker restart. The flag is now released whenever nothing is left in flight, and the level check is re-armed on the targets that are still open.
- A filled take-profit target is now disarmed as soon as it fills: the `dealTP` fill branch re-runs `checkDealSlMethods` / `checkDealsPriceExtremum` for every target, not only multi-SL ones. Previously `dealsForTPLevelCheck` kept pointing at the target that had just filled, and the next tick above that price re-sent the same `clientOrderId` — the trigger for the latch above.
- Editing a live deal's take-profit target now re-runs the TP level check immediately instead of waiting for the next price tick. The check only runs from `priceUpdateCallback`, and that cadence belongs to the venue's price feed, so a target moved below the market could sit armed but unevaluated for minutes.

### Changed

- `checkTPLevel`'s "already closing by TP" skip and `getDealTPLevelToCheck`'s armed-target/filled-ids line are logged at info instead of debug — debug is off by default, which is why the latch above was invisible in the logs.

## [1.57.1] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- A streamed balance item with no `locked` field no longer writes `locked: 0` over the stored hold. Kraken spot v2 (`websocket-connector-sh` ≥ 1.14.11) reports the total balance with no hold figure; zeroing `locked` on every event overstated "available" and undid the REST refresh within seconds. `AssetBalance.locked` is now optional; `core/src/utils/balanceWrite.ts` (`lockedUpdateFields` / `lockedInsertValue`, with spec) sets it on update only when present and defaults it to 0 only when the row is created.

### Added

- `getBalances` returns `updated` (ISO) per row — the oldest row's time when an asset is summed across exchanges — so the dashboard can mark a stale balance and offer a refresh (spec: main-app 002).

## [1.57.0] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- **A bot could hold resting orders while deaf to its account's `userStreamInfo` channel — no fills, no reconcile sweeps, no error, no retry.** A group of DCA bots on one account were loaded on the same worker within milliseconds of a process restart and never received another message on that channel until the next restart many hours later: every connector reconnect and every `RECONCILE VIA SWEEP` publish went unheard while the worker delivered other accounts' messages normally. `setExchangeCredentials` ran `unsubscribe(ch, cb)` before `subscribe(ch, cb)` for a callback it had never registered; in node-redis 5 that puts a real `UNSUBSCRIBE` on the wire behind a sibling's still-pending `SUBSCRIBE` (its local entry only exists once the reply is in), and every later `subscribe` is then deduplicated client-side. Client: several listeners. Server: nothing. Reproduced deterministically in `src/db/redisPubSub.spec.ts` against a fake that mirrors `@redis/client` 5.10 `pub-sub.js`. `RedisWrapper` now serialises `subscribe`/`unsubscribe` per channel, never sends a command for a listener it did not register, and gains `resubscribe(channel)` (one wire `UNSUBSCRIBE` + `SUBSCRIBE` for every registered callback) to repair a channel the client believes it holds. The redundant pre-subscribe unsubscribe is gone from both `setExchangeCredentials` implementations. Spec: `specs/002.user-stream-channel-lost-on-concurrent-subscribe.md`.
- A DCA bot stopped while a deal was open never released its user-stream listeners when that deal later closed (`stop()` only tore the stream down when no deal was open at stop time); the instance was dropped by the worker with live callbacks. `SharedStream.addListener` no longer skips the Redis subscribe silently when the first listener of a fresh worker arrives before the client connected.

### Added

- **User-stream liveness (spec 002 §4.5–4.6).** Every bot acknowledges any message on `userStreamInfo<uuid>` with `HSET gainium:userStreamAck:<uuid> <botId> <ms>` so the fill-failsafe can tell a deaf bot from a quiet one, and treats a `PING <ms>` probe as such (acked, never logged at info). On its 30 s consumer heartbeat a bot holding resting orders that heard nothing for `USER_STREAM_SILENCE_MS` (default 6 min) while the failsafe prober is alive (`gainium:failsafe:heartbeat` fresh with `pingMs > 0`) logs `USER-STREAM REPAIR`, runs `resubscribeUserStream()` (info channel, account event channel, fresh `open stream`), reconciles once the channel delivers again, and after two silent repairs raises a visible, non-stopping bot error. Pure decision module `src/bot/userStreamLiveness.ts` with its spec. Bot host internal-API method `resubscribeUserStream(exchangeUUID)` fans the repair out to every hosted bot on an account.

## [1.56.18] - 2026-09-03

### Fixed

- **A krakenUsdm take-profit the venue only partly fills no longer strands the remainder as an untracked position.** Kraken futures has no true market order — its `mkr` type is IOC with a 1% price-protection band, so a close that can't fill within the band at send time comes back `FILLED` for whatever the band allowed, with the rest cancelled by the venue itself, never `PARTIALLY_FILLED`. `buyRemainder`'s blanket `reduceOnly` exclusion (added when a broader carve-out was reverted in 1.56.11 after binanceUsdm/bybitLinear/bitgetUsdm all rejected every reduce-only remainder outright) meant this venue got no recovery attempt at all, even though its rejection reason in that same measurement (`wouldNotReducePosition`) is consistent with "the ask was bigger than the open position" rather than "reduce-only is refused outright" — recoverable by asking for less, which `buyRemainder`'s existing recursion already does.

  Two changes, both confined to `main.ts` (the class both grid and DCA bots share, so the fix covers both without a bot-type-specific patch): `buyRemainder` now lets krakenUsdm MARKET orders through instead of bailing on `reduceOnly`, and the `sendOrderToExchange` hook that recovers a bybit CANCELED-with-partial-fill on the spot (previously bybit-only) now also recognizes krakenUsdm's FILLED-with-shortfall shape. The second change closes a race the first alone would not: the synchronous placement-response path (`closeDealById` et al.) decides deal closure directly off the venue's response without going through the WS-driven consumer, so without widening this hook, whichever of the two paths saw the order first would still close on the unrecovered shortfall.

  No position-size lookup is needed: the remainder recovery order stays derived from `origQty - executedQty` as before, and a reduce-only ask larger than the real position simply comes back rejected — `buyRemainder`'s existing fall-through returns whatever was recovered by earlier, successful attempts rather than erroring. binanceUsdm/bybitLinear/bitgetUsdm remain excluded per the 1.56.11 measurement. See `specs/002.krakenusdm-tp-remainder-recovery.md`.

## [1.56.17] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- **The source build no longer breaks the moment `package-lock.json` is regenerated.** `@types/express@5.0.6` depends on `@types/express-serve-static-core: ^5.0.0`; the committed lockfile pins 5.0.6, so `npm ci` was clean — but any fresh `npm install` resolves 5.1.3, where `ParamsDictionary`'s index signature widened from `string` to `string | string[]` (a wildcard or repeated segment can match more than once). That produced 28 `tsc` errors, all in `src/server/v2/api.ts`, where ~24 handlers destructure `req.params` and pass the value on as a bare `string` — `dealType`, `botType`, `botId`, `dealId`, `id`, `sync`, `type` — plus two `.toUpperCase()` calls. Only self-hosted / from-source builders hit it, which is why it was reported from a source build rather than from a deployed one; the deployed tree installs from the lockfile and was never affected.

  Fixed at the origin rather than at the 24 call sites: the `APIMap` handler signature now reads `Request<Record<string, string>>`. Every v2 route uses only simple `:name` segments, and the 16 v1 routes folded in at the bottom of `v2API` carry no params at all, so the `string[]` arm is unreachable for every registered route — this narrows the type to what the router actually produces rather than casting over a case that can occur. The parent repo's `src/server/v2.ts` registers its agent/backtest handlers into this same map and is covered by the same one-line change. A wildcard route added later would invalidate the assumption, so the type carries a comment saying to type such a handler's params explicitly.

  Belt-and-braces, as a second independent guard: an `overrides` entry pins the transitive `@types/express-serve-static-core` to 5.0.6, so a regenerated lockfile reproduces the tree `npm ci` already installs (verified: zero package-version changes). The two guards are each sufficient on their own — the source now typechecks clean under 5.0.6 *and* 5.1.3, so the pin can be lifted whenever the types are deliberately bumped.

## [1.56.16] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- **Per-pair "Avg. deal duration" is no longer 0 for every pair of every multi-pair bot.** `botUpdateStats` fills `symbolStats[].duration.maxDealDuration` and then, three lines later, "computed" the average with a self-assignment guarded by `isNaN` — which never fired, because `getEmptyStats` seeds the field to 0. A reported multi-pair bot had every pair carrying a populated max and an average of exactly 0, including pairs whose single closed deal makes avg == max by definition, while the bot-wide `duration.general.avgDealDuration` (which does accumulate a `totalTime`) read correctly. The pair block now accumulates its own `duration.totalTime` / `duration.measuredDeals` and divides them. Deliberately not `numerical.deals.profit + loss`: that count predates the new counters on every bot already trading, so dividing by it would have replaced the honest 0 with a fraction of the real average on the first close after this ships. Bots with history start averaging from their next closed deal per pair; new bots are exact from the first one.

## [1.56.15] - 2026-09-02

### Fixed

- **A reconcile order lookup no longer costs 18 connector round trips when the connector is failing.** `reconcileLookup` spends its 3-attempt budget on `MainBot.getOrder`, but `Exchange.apiCall` already retries a connector 5xx/timeout SIX times at 500ms before giving up — so each "attempt" was really six round trips over ~3s and the real ceiling was 3 x 6. Seen in the field: a combo bot reconciling five resting orders against a connector answering HTTP 500 spent that full 3 x 6 ceiling on every order id, plus the prefetch, and surfaced as a "likely wedged" transport-failure burst — a handful of logical questions rendered as many times that many failures, into a connector that was already struggling. The retry budget now also stops on a failure the transport ladder has ALREADY been spent on, matched by the new `isTransportRetryExhausted` on the `Exchange connector | ` prefix that only `apiCall` throws, and only after those six attempts. Deliberately narrower than `isAmbiguousOrderFailure`: a transient reason carried in a NOTOK body on an HTTP 200 (`Response timeout`, a rate-limit) never sees the transport ladder, so it keeps the full 3 attempts. Measured against a fake 500-ing connector: 18 round trips -> 6, with success, definitive not-found, non-transport transient, and mid-ladder recovery all unchanged.

## [1.56.14] - 2026-09-01

### Fixed

- **A Coinbase Ed25519 API key now fails verification with instructions instead of a dead end.** The CDP portal creates Ed25519 keys BY DEFAULT, and our Coinbase SDK signs its JWTs with ES256 only, so such a key can never authenticate — with "Cloud Trading Keys" selected the user saw the raw jsonwebtoken refusal ("secretOrPrivateKey must be an asymmetric key when using ES256"), and under the default "Legacy Keys" an opaque 401. Worse, the cloud-type case fell into the key-type-mismatch rule, whose "switch to Legacy Keys" advice is the one change that cannot help. A new first-position Coinbase rule in `interpretVerifyFailure` recognises the key by its shape (raw 64-byte base64 secret, no PEM armour — checked before the key-type rules, under either Key Type) or by the ES256 signing error, and says what actually works: recreate the key at portal.cdp.coinbase.com with the ECDSA signature algorithm, and connect with the full `organizations/…/apiKeys/…` key name and the EC PEM secret. The venue's own message is still appended underneath, per this module's guidance-then-evidence rule.

### Fixed

- **A Hyperliquid order the venue had already accepted is no longer written off as CANCELED.** HL answers a status lookup for a brand-new order with `unknownOid` while it is still propagating, and the connector surfaces that as the placement's failure reason — but `unknownOid` can only escape `openOrder` AFTER the venue accepted the order, because the connector's pre-flight duplicate check uses the same token to mean "not a duplicate, go ahead". Classified as a refusal it reached the generic cleanup path and `deleteOrder`, which also unregisters the id from `SharedStream`, so the venue's later fill reached no bot at all. Seen in the field: an order accepted by the venue and reported `open` on our OWN user stream a fraction of a second later was written off ten seconds after that, then filled half an hour later into a position the bot could no longer see — the deal closed short of the account by that order's size.

  Three changes, in order of how early they stop it. `sendOrderToExchange` now keeps any order it is still tracking whose `orderId` is no longer the `-1` placeholder, whatever the failure text said: only the venue can set that id, so it outranks any classification of the error string. `unknownOid` joins `AMBIGUOUS_ORDER_FAILURE_MARKERS`, so the ambiguous-failure guard asks the venue before writing off rather than not at all. And `_handleUnknownOrder` takes a `justPlaced` mode that suspends the two shortcuts written for a stale reconcile — the `orderId === '-1'` fast-fail, which reads "no exchange id" as proof the order never landed when for a just-placed order it only means the response was lost, and the exhaustion write-off, which now leaves the local record to the reconcile/quarantine path (age floor + strikes) instead of deleting it.

  A definitive venue negative still writes off in both modes, and the placement resend loop cannot duplicate on this: `unknownOid` is ambiguous on the lookup too, so that loop returns the original failure and never re-sends.

## [1.56.12] - 2026-08-31

### Changed

- **The reconcile pass asks the venue about all of a bot's orders in one call, where the venue supports it.** `checkOrdersAfterReconnect` is a strictly serial `for (…) await getOrderForReconcile(o)`, which on Kraken — 20 REST tokens decaying 0.5/s per API key — arrives as a burst that drains the budget and then parks every remaining call for ~2.1s, the user's own `openOrder` included. In the field a large share of Kraken order placements queued behind it, and a larger share of `openOrder` calls, from an average load well inside the budget delivered in bursts. `primeReconcileBatch` prefetches the pass in one `getOrdersBatch` call (exchange-connector core 1.20.13, up to 50 Kraken orders per call) and `getOrder` serves from it.

  Strictly an optimisation, and the fallback is total: it resolves nothing the per-order path would not, and an exchange with no batch lookup, a transport with no such route (paper-trading mirrors the connector's endpoints and does not carry this one), a partial answer, an empty answer or a thrown error all leave the loop doing exactly what it does today. A venue that declines is memoed process-wide so it is asked once, not once per pass.

  The prefetch is hooked at the transport call inside `getOrder`, not around it, so the client-id → exchange-id translation and the `noExchangeOrderId` guard before it, and the `executedQty` conversion, KuCoin price reconstruction and CANCELED-with-fills promotion after it, all still run exactly as on the uncached path — a batched order is the same order. Entries are single-use and the map is dropped when the pass ends, so a prefetched row can never answer a question asked outside the pass that fetched it. That id translation is now a single `venueOrderId` method shared by both, because a prefetch keyed differently from what `getOrder` asks for would silently never hit.

## [1.56.11] - 2026-08-31

### Fixed

- Revert the 1.56.9 `buyRemainder` change: reduce-only orders are excluded from
  remainder recovery again. In the field, every reduce-only
  remainder order it placed was rejected with `executedQty: 0`
  (`ReduceOnly Order is rejected.` / `wouldNotReducePosition`) — the remainder is
  derived from the order, not the open position, so the venue refuses it. Nothing
  was recovered and the only effect was futile orders. The gate now
  documents why, so it is not lifted a third time.

## [1.56.10] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed

- Concurrent `getAllPrices` misses now share one exchange-connector round trip
  instead of one each. The Redis `allPrice` cache only ever coalesced callers
  arriving after a table was written; callers that missed together each made
  their own call, and price-driven callers in a bot process always miss
  together — every grid bot runs its own `priceTimerFn` keyed by bot id, so N
  bots on one exchange fired N calls in the same tick. On Binance USDⓈ-M that
  is N x weight-10 `futures_getAllPrices` against a process-wide weight budget
  shared by every Binance user on that connector node, parking their
  `openOrder`/`cancelOrder` behind the flood. The flood was self-sustaining: a
  parked call answers `Response timeout` (NOTOK) and a NOTOK table is never
  cached, so the cache could not re-warm and every later tick fanned out again.
  Measured with a group of bots on one exchange: the whole fan-out collapses to
  one connector call on a cold cache, and to 3 across three ticks while the connector was congested.

## [1.56.9] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed

- Reduce-only take-profits that underfill now get their remainder re-placed.
  `buyRemainder` returned early on any `reduceOnly` order, so every futures
  venue skipped remainder recovery entirely: in the field, nearly every
  underfilled reduce-only TP stranded, against a small fraction of non-reduce-only
  ones. The unsold residue sat on the venue untracked, with no TP and no
  SL, consuming margin until base orders were rejected `Not enough balance`. The
  narrow `kucoinFutures || okx || coinm` exclusion the early return had grown
  around is kept.

### Changed

- `PARTIAL_TP_TOLERANCE` 0.1% -> 5%. Measured venue rounding dust reaches 0.93%
  (median 0.196%), so the old threshold classified routine lot-size rounding as
  stranding and would have held deals open for remainders below the venue's
  minimum order size. Real strandings are 50-98% short.

## [1.56.8] - 2026-08-30

### Fixed

- `updateBalance` (the dashboard's portfolio refresh) no longer waits on the
  on-demand `userSnapshots` run without a deadline. One wedged venue could hold
  it past the dashboard's own 30s client timeout — waits of well over a minute were seen —
  so the user saw a failed request rather than a slow one. The refresh is now
  capped at 25s (`SNAPSHOT_REFRESH_DEADLINE_MS`), after which the last stored
  snapshot is served and the refresh keeps running in the background.

## [1.56.7] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- `getAllOpenPositions` now returns `linkedBots` on each position: every Gainium
  deal mapping onto that venue position, with the size each one holds, the bot's
  start condition and its status. A venue position is a single netted lot that
  several deals can share, so the existing single-bot fields could only ever
  describe one of them.

### Fixed

- Bot attribution for shared positions no longer discards all but one claim.
  `getImportedPositions` assigned into a single-value map, so each later claim
  overwrote its predecessor and only one bot was ever reported — grid bots were
  evaluated last, so a grid bot masked a DCA bot on the same position. The
  legacy `botId`/`botName`/`botType` fields deliberately still report that last
  claim, so the existing dashboard sees exactly what it saw before.

## [1.56.5] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed

- **Bots now reconcile their orders after a socket reconnect, not only after a
  process restart.** `checkOrdersAfterReconnect` is triggered by a user-stream
  (re)subscribe, but Kraken's and Binance's reconnect handlers never published
  that signal — only bybit's and bitget's did. A Kraken safety order
  filled in the afternoon was therefore not booked until the following
  morning, when the worker was next restarted: many hours in which the deal
  held twice the position the engine thought it had, with its take-profit
  priced off a stale average. (Publisher side ships in websocket-connector.)
- **A transient order lookup in the reconcile pass is retried instead of
  silently dropping the order.** `!res.data` was treated the same as "the venue
  says this order is gone": one warning, `continue`, nothing to re-check it.
  Lookups failed that way across many bots. `reconcileLookup`
  now retries with exponential backoff and ±50% jitter, and stops immediately
  on a definitive not-found so the quarantine path keeps owning that case.
- **The reconcile pass no longer stampedes.** A user-stream connector restart
  re-subscribes every account at once, which put every DCA bot into the pass
  within seconds — a large burst in a single second — each calling `getOrder` per open
  order, manufacturing the very lookup failures the pass exists to catch. The
  start is now spread over a random window (`BOT_RECONCILE_SPREAD_MS`).
- Reconcile lookup failures are reported once per pass with a count instead of
  one warning per order.

## [1.56.4] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- **`exchange/helpers.ts` `resolveCoinbaseKeysType`** — corrects the Coinbase
  key type when the submitted credentials plainly contradict it. A Coinbase
  Developer Platform key is self-identifying (the key NAME is a resource path,
  the secret is a PEM private key) and cloud auth cannot work without them, so
  a CDP key submitted under "Legacy Keys" is now simply authenticated the right
  way. The selector sits behind an Advanced Settings disclosure defaulting to
  Legacy, and getting it wrong was the largest verification-failure bucket in
  the field.
- Correcting this silently is safe in a way the OKX origin is NOT, and the
  difference is the point: `keysType` only chooses between `{apiKey, apiSecret}`
  and `{cloudApiKeyName, cloudApiSecret}` when building the client, so it
  changes how we authenticate and nothing about what the account may trade.
  `okxSource` selects a venue with a different tradable universe, which is why
  that one is only ever reported.
- The correction is one-directional. Absence of the CDP markers is not evidence
  of a legacy key — a truncated paste looks identical — so `cloud` is never
  downgraded; that direction stays a message. Paper providers are excluded:
  their credentials are minted by paper-trading, not typed.

## [1.56.2] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- **`verify.probeOkxOrigins` — work out which OKX platform a key actually
  belongs to.** OKX runs each region as a separate venue and a key only
  authenticates against its issuer, so a perfectly good my.okx.com key and a
  nonexistent one produce the same "API key doesn't exist" on okx.com. The
  origin selector sits behind an "Advanced Settings" disclosure that defaults
  to okx.com, so EU users — exactly the people who need to change it — often
  never see it. This class was a large share of all OKX verification
  failures. On a key-not-found rejection the other origins are now swept
  concurrently under an 8s deadline, and the failure message names the platform
  that authenticated.
- The sweep is narrowly gated by `isOkxOriginSuspect`: a timeout must never
  reach it. Around half of those same failures were the venue not answering in time,
  and firing three more `sendtoall` fan-outs at an already-slow venue is how
  the OKX rate-limit pile-up of an earlier incident was built. A wrong-passphrase
  rejection is excluded too — the key was found, so the origin is right.
- The result NAMES the correct origin rather than switching to it. `addExchange`
  derives the tradable universe from `okxSource` BEFORE it verifies — OKX
  Europe has no coin-margined product and its X-Perps are beta-gated to the
  Alpha group — so adopting an origin at this point would put the user on the
  EU venue with none of those guards applied. Ambiguous or overrunning sweeps
  resolve to "no answer" and the original failure is reported unchanged.

## [1.56.1] - 2026-08-29

### Fixed

- **A failed exchange-key verification now says what the exchange actually
  refused.** The connector already reports the precise cause — "API key doesn't
  exist" (wrong OKX regional origin), "Unmatched IP", "you are in unified
  account mode", a Binance permission object naming the switch that is off —
  but it arrives as `JSON.stringify(BaseReturn)`, and the resolver forwarded a
  reason only when it contained no brace and no "catch". That discarded nearly
  every venue error in favour of `API keys not valid for <tradeType>`. In the
  field that single message covered the large majority of verification failures
  across many distinct users, several of whom retried repeatedly. New
  `exchange/verifyFailureMessage.ts` unwraps the envelope and, where a rule
  recognises the error, prepends what to do about it. Interpretation is
  strictly additive — the venue's own sentence is always kept underneath, so a
  rule that is wrong or has gone stale can add noise but can never hide the
  evidence. Guidance describes venue behaviour only and never names Gainium
  egress IPs, because core also runs on self-hosted installs that call
  exchanges from their own address.

### Added

- `exchange/helpers.ts` `requiresPassphrase(provider)` — okx / kucoin / bitget
  and their per-market variants. The credential-write paths need this because
  the edit form legitimately leaves the passphrase blank, so the resolver has
  to decide for itself whether blank means "unchanged" or "missing".

## [1.56.0] - 2026-08-29

### Added

- **v2 REST API support for hedge bots (`hedgeCombo` / `hedgeDca`)** — a community request. `GET /api/v2/bots/{hedgeCombo,hedgeDca}` and `.../details` list and fetch a hedge bot with both legs populated, and start / stop / restore / archive / clone now accept the two hedge types alongside `dca`, `combo` and `grid`. The engine already supported every one of these operations for hedge bots; only the REST layer refused the bot type.
- **Hedge profit is aggregated server-side** (`bot/hedgeAggregate.ts`). A hedge bot is a WRAPPER over two child bots, and the wrapper's own `profit` / `profitToday` / `workingTimeNumber` are written once at creation and never updated — the engine only ever writes `status` back to it. The dashboard has always summed the legs client-side; without this, every hedge bot would have reported a flat 0 profit over REST. `profit`, `profitByAssets`, `profitToday`, `unrealizedProfit`, `workingTimeNumber` and `dealsInBot` are now summed from the legs at read time. The two legs are independent bots that may settle in DIFFERENT quote assets, so the `*Usd` fields and `profitByAssets` are always exact while the native-unit fields are only summed when the quote assets agree — `profitBasis.native` (`exact` | `mixed`) says which you got. Used by the REST layer only; the GraphQL/dashboard path is unchanged.
- `POST /api/v2/bots/{hedgeType}/{botId}/start` accepts an optional `hedgeConfig: { LONG, SHORT }` body naming what each leg should do with a position it already holds, validated against the action enum before it can reach a leg's `action` field.
- `POST /api/v2/bots/{hedgeType}/{botId}/clone` takes PER-LEG overrides — `{ long?, short?, sharedSettings? }` — because a hedge bot's two legs have their own pairs, exchanges and settings. A flat settings body (what the dca/combo/grid clone takes) is rejected with a 400 that explains the shape rather than being silently ignored. Legs are matched by their own `strategy`, never by position in `bots`.
- `PUT /api/v2/bots/{hedgeType}/{botId}` and `.../pairs` still reject hedge bots — their settings and pair lists are per leg — but now say so instead of listing the accepted types.

## [1.55.5] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- **The Deal Returns scatter silently dropped every deal that was open when the bot's settings last changed.** `getBotProfitChartData` read `botProfitChart`, a denormalized one-row-per-closed-deal shadow that only `DCABotHelper.botUpdateStats` writes — and that method returns early, before the write, for any deal whose `createTime` predates the bot's `resetStatsAfter`. Changing order sizing (`baseOrderSize`/`orderSize`/`ordersCount`/`volumeScale`/`maxNumberOfOpenDeals`) stamps `resetStatsAfter`, which is right for the aggregate Statistics tab but permanently erased the straddling deals from this chart, while the deals table beside it still listed them. Because the deals open longest are the ones most likely to straddle a settings change, the points lost were the best ones: a reported bot's scatter topped out far below its real best deal, and the deals table listed more than twice as many deals above a given return as the chart plotted. The resolver now derives the series from the closed deals themselves (`$match` → small `$project` → `$sort closeTime` → `$limit 500`, same 500-point cap), using the new pure `dealReturnPercentage()` helper that mirrors `botUpdateStats`' `perc` expression over the settings snapshot frozen on each deal. This also repairs existing history — no backfill could reconstruct rows that were never written, but deals are never cold-archived (only orders and transactions are), so the full series is recomputable on the next read for every affected bot. Verified against that bot's real deals: every closed deal is plotted (the one exception is a zero-profit cancel, which `botUpdateStats` skipped too), the maximum matches its real best deal, and almost all pairable pre-existing rows reproduce bit-identically, the rest to float noise.

## [1.55.4] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- **`orders` had no `dealId` index, so every per-deal order lookup full-scanned the collection.** `registerIndexes` declared `userId`, `botId`, `clientOrderId`, `latestOrders_filled` and `fillFailsafe_resting` but nothing on `dealId`, and the deal-scoped queries are a family — `{dealId,typeOrder}`, `{dealId,status,typeOrder}` as both a find and a `$match/$group`, `{dealId,side}`, `{dealId}` sorted by `transactTime`, and `{created:{$gte,$lt},dealId,typeOrder}` — for which `dealId` equality is the only indexable predicate any of them has. In the field that last shape alone dominated slow-query time on the database, examining an enormous number of documents to return a handful of rows and taking seconds per op; the scans also evict everyone else's working set from the WiredTiger cache, so unrelated queries degrade with them. `orderSchema.index({ dealId: 1 })` is now declared, so `models.order.syncIndexes()` builds and keeps it at boot rather than relying on a hand-run `createIndex`, which can report success while building nothing. Not compound with `status`/`typeOrder`: `status` is mutable and moving entries in an index that size is the write regression the partial indexes beside it were shaped to avoid, whereas `dealId` is effectively write-once — rewritten with the same value on every fill event, and genuinely reassigned only by a deal merge. Measured on a seeded 300k-doc collection: 300,000 docsExamined → 1 returned at 249ms becomes an `IXSCAN dealId_1` at 2 docsExamined and 4ms, identical result sets, no measurable insert/update cost.

## [1.55.3] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- **Trailing take profit could never arm on a deal whose settings had been edited, leaving it with no take profit at all.** `getTrailingSettings`, `getDealMoveSlPrice` and `getDealSlRefPrice` read the deal's reference price as `settings.avgPrice ?? deal.avgPrice`, while every other site in the file writes the same expression as `settings.avgPrice || deal.avgPrice`. `0 ?? x` is `0`, and an edited deal can carry `settings.avgPrice: 0` — the dashboard's mass deal-edit seeds its form from the bot-form defaults, which declare `avgPrice: 0`, then diffs that against each selected deal's real average and ships the difference, zeroing every deal in the selection at once. A zero reference does not weaken the exits, it removes them: `trailingTpPrice` becomes `0`, which `checkTrailing` gates the arm branch on as falsy, so trailing TP never armed however far price ran — and because `trailingTp` also suppresses the resting TP limit order, the deal had no take profit of any kind while `bestPrice` kept updating, so it still looked actively managed. The same zero put move SL's trigger at `0`, which `last >= required` satisfies on the first tick of a long, and the `baseSlOn: avg` stop at `0` — unreachable for a long, instantly hit for a short. All three now resolve through `dealRefPrice`, and `updateDealSettings` drops an unusable `avgPrice` from an incoming patch so the zero can no longer be persisted by any client (both dashboards, `/api/updateDeal`, the v2 API, the AI deal tools). Pinned by `src/bot/dealRefPrice.spec.ts`.

## [1.55.2] - 2026-08-28

### Added

- **`resetStatsAfter` is now readable over GraphQL** (`fullDCABot`, `fullComboBot`). The field
  has existed on the bot document for years and drives real behaviour — changing order sizing
  (`baseOrderSize`, `orderSize`, `ordersCount`, `volumeScale`, `orderSizeType`, `useDca`,
  `maxNumberOfOpenDeals`) or `profitCurrency` clears `stats`/`symbolStats` and stamps it, after
  which `botUpdateStats` skips every deal created before that instant. Nothing exposed it, so the
  dashboards could not tell a user that a bot's Statistics tab describes a SHORTER window than its
  deals list, and the disagreement read as wrong data (a bot whose stats counted only part of
  its closed deals). Additive and read-only: a new nullable `Float` on two existing types, no
  resolver change — `getBot` already returns the whole lean document.

## [1.55.1] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- **A percentage add/reduce funds request was not a percentage of the position.** `addDealFunds` and `reduceDealFunds` sized a `perc` request as the deal's cost basis (`usage.current.quote`) divided by `deal.lastPrice`. `lastPrice` reads like a current price and is not one: `updateDeal` maintains it as a running MINIMUM of fill prices on a long and a MAXIMUM on a short. Cost basis over the *lowest* fill resolves to more base than the deal holds — by exactly the deal's drawdown ratio `avgPrice/lastPrice` — so the error was invisible on a deal that had not averaged down and widened with every safety order that filled: about +1.9% three levels deep and +8.0% eight levels deep. Beyond that the `tpQty` guard treats the request as covering the whole remaining position and CLOSES the deal instead of reducing it, so on a deep ladder a 93% reduce was a full exit. The divisor is now `avgPrice` — the deal's VWAP over its filled orders, which is what bought the cost basis, so cost basis over it is the base acquired by construction — falling back to `lastPrice` only for a deal with no fills, where the two coincide. This restores the documented behaviour: a long holding 1 ETH reduced by 20% sells 0.2 ETH. Futures shorts divided by the running maximum and so under-sized; they are corrected in the opposite direction. Spot short and coin-M deals carry a base amount and never divided by a price — those branches are unchanged. The two percentage branches were hand-maintained copies that had already drifted apart once, and now share a single `percentFundsBasis`.

## [1.54.7] - 2026-08-28

### Fixed

- **A fallback fee rate could permanently overwrite an account's real one.** When a venue cannot say what an account pays, the connector answers with the published schedule's entry rung — a plausible number with `status: OK`, indistinguishable from a real rate at the call site — and the fee sweep wrote it straight over whatever was stored. On Kraken that rung matches NO tier in the live schedule (it reads 0.40%/0.25%; real Tier 1 is 0.80%/0.40%), so the replacement was not merely stale but a rate the venue offers nobody, understating the true cost by about half. Observed in the field: a transient `EGeneral:Temporary lockout` made TradeVolume fail for several accounts mid-sweep and most of an account's pairs were overwritten in a single pass — a meaningful share of Kraken connections were left on it, some of them with live bots and rates months out of date. These fees size the base-order gross-up and the take-profit, so the error is real money. A fallback may now only CREATE a row that does not exist yet; once any rate is stored, only the venue's own answer may replace it. `source` is persisted on the fee row so the two can be told apart. Poisoned accounts self-heal on their next successful lookup — verified on a poisoned account, which went from the fallback rung back to its real venue-reported rate across every affected pair.

## [1.54.6] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- `getAllUserFees` dropped `UserFee.source` on the way through the exchange layer, so 1.54.3's fallback-attribution logging never fired. The mapper rebuilds each entry as a `{pair, maker, taker}` literal rather than spreading, which silently discards any field the connector adds unless it is named — the single-pair `getUserFees` returns its response unmapped and was unaffected. Verified in the field: the connector reported `EGeneral:Permission denied` for an account on every sweep while main-app logged zero fallback lines.

## [1.54.5] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- **A follow-up to 1.54.4: an observed fee could be overwritten with zero on the grid/combo transaction path.** That path is built on an invariant the *estimate* happens to satisfy — for a buy the fee sits in `comBase` and `comQuote` is 0, for a sell the other way round — and four separate conversions (`comBase = comQuote / price` and friends) read that shape. A real fee does not satisfy it: Kraken bills the base asset on a sell and Coinbase bills quote on both sides, so writing the venue's split in directly left the opposite field at 0 and let the very next conversion clobber the real number. The observed total is now expressed on the trade's side before it is written (`observedFeeOnSide`), which keeps the magnitude — the thing that was wrong — and leaves the shape alone.
- `getCommDeal` converts an observed fee at the ORDER's own fill price rather than the deal's current price. The estimate it replaces was per order at `v.price`, so a deal that had moved since a fill would otherwise value that fill's fee at today's price.

## [1.54.4] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- **`deal.feePaid` is now an OBSERVATION rather than a computation, wherever the venue reported one.** It was previously the sum of `qty * price * storedFeeRate` over every filled order — an estimate that is only ever as good as the stored rate, and therefore wrong for a whole deal whenever that rate has drifted from what the venue really charges. exchange-connector core 1.20.8 and paper-trading core 1.3.8 now report the fee each venue actually took, and `CommonOrder` mirrors their fields here (`feePaid`, `feeSide`, `feeAsset`, `feeBreakdown`) — all optional and additive. The captured fee is persisted on the order document.
- The same observation now feeds `deal.commission` (`getCommDeal`) and the combo/grid transaction's `pureFeeBase`/`pureFeeQuote`, so the deal's cost basis, its P&L and its reported fee all come from one source.
- **The user-stream commission is no longer discarded.** websocket-connector has always forwarded `commission` + `commissionAsset` on both `executionReport` and `ORDER_TRADE_UPDATE`, and `convertExecutionReportToOrder` threw them away. This matters most on Binance, whose order endpoints report no fee at all: for an order that rests and fills later, the stream is the only source there is. The stream reports per TRADE, so the fee is accumulated across slices, made idempotent against a replayed report by a `feeTradeId` high-water mark (venue trade ids increase monotonically, so a report at or below the mark is ignored, and a report with no id at all is ignored because a repeat could not be told from a new trade).

### Notes

- **`commission` remains the fallback, per ORDER rather than per deal**, and a fee that cannot be resolved is NEVER booked as zero. A zeroed fee is a claim that the fill was free, and replaces a roughly-right number with a definitely-wrong one. Three cases fall back: the venue reported nothing (paper legs from before core 1.3.8, an order with no fills, Binance futures order lookups, any order predating this change); the venue charged in an asset that is neither side of the pair (a BNB, BGB or KCS discount) — the amount is kept on the order but converting it needs an FX rate at the fill's timestamp that is not available here; or a multi-currency `feeBreakdown` where not every leg is on the pair. `observedFeeSplit` returns `null` rather than a zeroed split so this cannot be got wrong by accident.
- An observed fee already on an order survives a later poll that reports none — `mergeCommonOrderWithOrder` rebuilds the order from the exchange payload, so without that the stream-captured Binance fee would be silently erased by the next order check.
- Covered by a standalone ts-node check (`src/bot/orderFee.spec.ts`; this repo has no test runner).

## [1.54.3] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- `UserFee.source` mirrored from the exchange-connector contract (optional/additive), so `updateUserFee` can log WHICH user received published-schedule fallback rates instead of their account's real ones. The connector cannot say — it receives credentials only, never a userId — so the sweep is the only place the two halves join. Previously a degraded lookup was silent: it answers OK with a plausible number and the stale rate is written to the user's fees unremarked.

## [1.54.2] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- **A Kraken DCA deal opened with no safety orders on the exchange at all.** `placeOrders` looks the pair up with `getExchangeInfo`, which is keyed on the platform form (`ETH-EUR`), but callers that take the symbol off an exchange ORDER pass the venue's own spelling — on Kraken `ETHEUR`, `XBTUSD`, `XRPUSD`. The lookup missed, and the method returned before placing anything. Since the ladder is built when the base order fills and handed straight to `placeOrders` as `orderBo.symbol`, it was dropped on every deal open: the deal ran with only its base order, and the ladder reached the exchange only if something later reloaded the bot (a settings save, a restart, a worker recycle), because the restore path passes the deal's own symbol. Silent — the miss is a warning in the service log, with no bot message and nothing on the deal, so a user could only find it by looking at their exchange. It shows up as `Exchange info not found for XBTUSD` / `XRPUSD`. The pair is now resolved from the deal, with the argument kept as the fallback when the deal is not in memory; two combo callers carried the identical defect and are fixed by the same change. Venues whose native symbol already matches the platform form (most of them) were never affected.

## [1.54.1] - 2026-08-27

### Fixed

- Cancelling a Kraken **spot** order no longer cancels a different order. `cancelOrderOnExchange` addressed the venue by our client order id, and Kraken spot has no client-id lookup — the connector falls back to `userref = parseInt(clientOrderId.substring(0, 8), 16)`, which stops at the first non-hex char, so every `D-*` id collapses to userref 13 and every `CMB-*` to 12. `getOrder` then returned whichever same-userref order the account listed first and we cancelled that one, reporting success. Kraken spot now uses the stored `orderId` (the Kraken txid), routing through the connector's exact `isKrakenSpotTxid` → `getSpotOrderByTxid` path — the swap `_handleUnknownOrder` already made in 1.32.4 for the same reason. In the field many Kraken txids were shared by more than one client order id, across order rows on the large majority of Kraken-spot bots.

## [1.54.0] - 2026-08-27

### Added

- `getBotDcaUsage` / `getComboBotDcaUsage` — DCA-usage histogram folded in Mongo over all of a bot's deals, for the dashboard's DCA Analysis widget

## [1.53.14] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- Bot notifications now name the pair that actually errored. `processError` labelled every message with `settings.pair[0]`, so on a multi-pair bot each notification claimed the bot's first pair no matter which one failed — a row could read `BTC-USDC` above a message about AIOZ. The occurrence's own symbol is now threaded through `handleErrors` / `handleOrderErrors` (`order.symbol`, or the deal's symbol), and `settings.pair[0]` stays the fallback only for bot-level conditions that have no erroring pair, such as a revoked API key. Across a month of `Not enough balance` messages in the field, a meaningful minority of machine-checkable rows named a pair contradicted by their own message text. The same value feeds the realtime `bot message` socket payload, so the notification bell is corrected too.

## [1.53.13] - 2026-08-26

### Changed

- The base-order fallback notice added in 1.53.12 now logs at debug level for the `nominal` case and keeps log level for the two that are worth reading. Measured after the fix: the `nominal` branch is the routine one — every deal whose opening order has not landed yet passes through it, and it dominated the DCA workers' log volume — and it is the case with nothing to diagnose. `deal` and `accounted` say something about a deal's books and stay visible. The line also prints `(new)` rather than an empty id for a deal that does not exist yet.

## [1.53.12] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- **A DCA take-profit was sized from the NOMINAL base order size instead of the position the deal actually held.** `getTPOrder` builds the close as `sum(entry fills) + base order`, and when the base order's row was not in the order map it re-derived one from `baseOrderSize`. Two things put it in that state and both are now closed.

  First, a base order that partially fills and is then CANCELED is a terminal row, and `loadOrders` filtered `status: CANCELED` out of its query — so after a worker restart `findBaseOrderByDeal`, which is written for precisely this case (`['CANCELED','FILLED']` plus `executedQty > 0`), could never find it. A deal's base order executed a fraction of its size before being cancelled; the nominal put the whole size back, and the deal asked the venue to sell far more base than it held. The venue rejected it, which leaves a deal with no take-profit at all. Open deals now load their partially-executed cancelled entry orders back, scoped by deal id so the query examines the same documents as before. The same rows are what the deal fee split and `updateUsage`'s filled base were already written to read.

  Second, deals restored from the Redis snapshot had their orders — take-profit included — generated *before* `_loadOrders` populated the order book, so the sizing saw no fills whatsoever and the nominal became the entire take-profit, far short of the position on the deals affected. The restored deals are now seeded first and their orders generated after the load. That also fixes a second-order case: generating and setting a deal in one pass meant `getDeal` could not see the deal whose orders it was generating, and `findBaseOrderByDeal` returns nothing without it.

  The base order size is now taken from the deal's own books when its row is missing — the volume the counted fills do not explain IS the base order, exactly, with no reference to settings. The settings-derived fallback is kept for the case it was written for, a deal whose opening order has not landed yet, and is no longer reachable once the deal holds anything.
- A safety order that partially filled and was then cancelled now counts toward the take-profit size. It was matched `status: FILLED` only, so every one of them under-stated the position by whatever it had already executed — the same omission as the base order, on the orders that outnumber it.
- The settings-derived base order fallback now converts `usd` sizes through the USD rate and treats an unset `orderSizeType` as quote, matching `getBaseOrder`. `percFree`/`percTotal` are a percentage of a live balance the take-profit path cannot see, so they fall to the venue minimum rather than being read as a coin quantity — a `percTotal` deal had rested a take-profit several times larger than the base it held.

## [1.53.11] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- **A keep-orders reload rebuilt the bot's order book from a stale Redis snapshot and silently lost every order created since that snapshot was written.** `setOrdersToRedis` is `@RunWithDelay`'d and the timer resets on every order mutation, so under churn the snapshot is not one debounce interval stale — it is as old as the last quiet gap in the bot's order activity, seconds or more. A keep-orders reload (a settings save, a deal restore) sets `serviceRestart` *and* `secondRestart`, then `clearClassProperties` wipes `orders`/`ordersKeys` and refills them from `_loadOrders`, which gated its Redis shortcut on bare `serviceRestart` and so took the snapshot. Orders newer than it were not marked stale, they were gone: no entry in `orders`, none in `ordersKeys`. `accountCallback` then dropped every later stream event for them at its `ordersKeys` guard and logged nothing at any level, so a fill that really happened on the venue was discarded and the deal sat holding a position the bot did not know about until a REST reconcile happened to notice hours later — and where the lost order was a resting safety order, the reload re-placed the same price level moments after, duplicating it on the exchange. `_loadOrders` now uses the same `serviceRestart && !secondRestart` cold-start guard as the deals snapshot beside it and as the rest of the engine; a reload reads the DB, which is one bot and cheap, and a mass restart still gets the snapshot it exists for. Grid was never affected (it passes `skipRedis`); DCA, combo and hedge shared the path.
- A fill or partial fill delivered for an order the bot is not tracking is now reported as `STREAM-DESYNC` instead of being dropped in silence. `SharedStream` routes these to one bot specifically, so the bot's book disagreeing with the router is a real desync and, on a fill, money about to go unbooked — it was the same silent `return` that kept the loss above invisible.

## [1.53.10] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- Booking a partial fill off a canceled take-profit now requires a usable `updateTime`. Cancel records written from a REST response rather than a stream event can carry a bogus `executedQty` next to `updateTime: -1`; such rows exist in the field, and one looks exactly like a partial fill on an order the venue never filled. Trusting it would invent a sale and under-size every later take-profit by the phantom amount — a silent failure in the opposite direction to the one 1.53.8 fixed. Stream events always carry a real timestamp, so nothing legitimate is lost.

## [1.53.9] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- A keep-orders reload — a settings save, or a deal restore — no longer re-places a running deal's take-profit. 1.53.8 left this path alone because `placeOrders` has its own take-profit guard, but that guard only covers one of the three ways the recompute can land. `currentOrders` is rebuilt from the deal's current price, so the recomputed take-profit sits at a different price and often a different size than the one already resting: a larger one makes `placeOrders` cancel the resting take-profit and send a replacement, and one of equal size makes it place a second take-profit on top (the price differs, so `isOrderExistInDeal` finds no counterpart and neither quantity branch fires). Only a smaller one was skipped. The first two reach every open deal in a single pass, so a 50-pair bot re-placed ~50 take-profits inside two minutes with the entries hours in the past — which Binance Futures scores as ~50 orders placed against no fills in the same 10-minute cycle, an unfilled ratio of 1.0 against a 0.99 ban threshold, and restricts the whole account for. A running deal keeps the settings and the orders it started with, so its resting take-profit is the correct one and a save has no business touching it; one is now placed only when the deal has none resting. The two legitimate cancels are unchanged, both being scoped to a single deal: a deal closing cancels its own take-profit, and a position that changes size has its take-profit resized by the fill path.

## [1.53.8] - 2026-08-26

### Fixed

- A partially-filled take-profit that was later canceled no longer loses the part that executed. `updatePartiallyFilledTP` records it off the PARTIALLY_FILLED event, but not every venue emits one — Coinbase keeps such an order OPEN — and `processCanceledOrder` was an empty stub even though the cancel report carries the executed quantity. The deal went on counting base the account no longer held, so every later take-profit was sized above the free balance, rejected by the venue, and the deal was left with no take-profit and no way to close it. The record keys on `clientOrderId`, so seeing both events books the quantity once.
- A keep-orders reload — a settings save, or a deal restore — no longer stacks a second ladder of safety orders on the live one. The reload deliberately leaves the deal's orders resting, but still re-placed a full set: `currentOrders` is rebuilt from the deal's current price, so its levels sit at prices and sizes that `isOrderExistInDeal` (which matches on price+qty+side) finds no counterpart for, and the deal ended up with twice the resting exposure the user configured. A take-profit cannot duplicate this way — `placeOrders` has its own guard — so that path is unchanged.

## [1.53.7] - 2026-08-25

### Fixed

- A DCA deal whose 35s enter-market fallback was refused by the venue is no longer stranded without an order. `checkBaseOrder` cancels the resting limit base order to make room for the market entry and used to latch `enterMarketPrice` before sending it, so a refusal — a Coinbase book in limit-only mode — left the deal in `start` with nothing on the book and the latch permanently suppressing any further attempt. The latch now records the venue's answer rather than our intent, and a limit-only refusal re-places the base order as a limit instead of abandoning the entry. Such deals still counted as an active pair on the Bots tab while showing no trade, which is the count mismatch users reported.

## [1.53.6] - 2026-08-25

### Changed

- `priceBalancesUsd` now builds its tokenized-stock fallback map lazily. `pairs` has no index on `assetCategory`, so that lookup is a collection scan, and it is only ever read for an asset the crypto rate table could not price — but it ran on every call, including the all-crypto portfolios that are the overwhelming majority. With `getBalances(includeUsdValues)` this path is now on every dashboard portfolio view, so the scan is skipped unless something actually needs it.

## [1.53.5] - 2026-08-25

### Added

- `getBalances` can value each holding in USD server-side (`includeUsdValues`), reusing the same `priceBalancesUsd` per-venue path the portfolio snapshot cron and the public REST balances endpoint already use. The dashboard previously had to derive a price by matching an exchange ticker against the screener's coin symbols, which silently rendered `$0.00` for anything the screener could not match — a coin renamed upstream (Coinbase still lists Toncoin as `TON`; the screener carries CoinGecko's `gram`) or a long-tail listing the screener does not carry at all. An asset the venue publishes no rate for now returns `null` rather than a confident zero, so a consumer can tell "worth nothing" apart from "we could not price this". Off by default; existing callers are byte-for-byte unchanged.

## [1.53.4] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- Backtest files are served only from inside the `user-files` directory. `loadBacktestDetails` read a path back from the database and handed it straight to `sendFile`, trusting whatever was stored. The writer bounds what it creates today, but rows written before that guard are still in the database, so the serving side now re-checks containment against the same root rather than trusting the stored value. Reported on `main-app-sh` PR #12 by M1ch43lV.

## [1.53.3] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- Combo futures bots now refuse to start when the symbol already holds a position on the opposite side, the same rule DCA and Grid bots have always had. On a one-way (non-hedge) account the venue keeps a single net position per symbol, so two opposing combo bots fought over it: the second bot's reduce-only exits were rejected by the exchange and its deal could only be closed by hand. Hedge legs are unaffected.

## [1.53.2] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- A DCA bot-settings save really does leave running deals their orders now. 1.53.0 stopped re-deriving each open deal's settings — that part held — but it removed only one of **two** teardowns, and not the one users were hitting. `restoreWork`, which runs further down `start()`, cancels every resting order for any reload it does not classify as a cold service restart, and the reload flags deliberately make a settings save not look like one. So the cancel moved instead of going away: a multi-pair bot had its whole order book pulled and re-placed about two minutes after an edit. A reload that must keep the book now says so explicitly, and `restoreWork` reconciles against the venue instead of tearing it down. Combo was never affected — its own `restoreWork` override tests `serviceRestart` alone — and that asymmetry is now pinned by a test rather than left as a coincidence.

## [1.53.1] - 2026-08-24

### Fixed

- A bot reload no longer replays stale signal deals. `restoreWork` walks every deal still in `start` and re-placed its opening order regardless of why the deal existed — so a deal created by a TradingView webhook that was refused at the time (for example under a Binance Quantitative Rules restriction) could be executed hours later by a reload, opening a trade at a moment the signal never described. A reload could replay a day-old webhook deal into a long the strategy had since flipped short on. The sweep now applies the same rule as the Quantitative Rules give-up path: only an ASAP deal — whose start carries no timing — is re-attempted; a deal opened by a webhook, indicator, timer or manual click is cancelled instead, and its own trigger opens the next one.

## [1.53.0] - 2026-08-24

### Changed

- A bot-settings save now applies to **new deals only**. Deals that are already running keep the settings they opened with and keep their resting orders. Previously every save re-derived each open deal's settings from the new bot settings and then cancelled and re-placed the bot's whole order book — take-profits included — so an edit that could not possibly affect an open deal still re-targeted live take-profits, cost every order its place in the exchange queue, and left open deals with no TP or SL resting on the exchange for the width of the cancel/re-place window. Changing a Deal Start filter, which only ever decides whether a *new* deal opens, tore down and rebuilt the orders of every deal already running. This applies to DCA, Combo and both Hedge types; a Grid bot has no per-deal settings and still rebuilds its ladder on save. A running deal is still editable on its own, from that deal's menu. Combo's TP/SL-only shortcut, which pushed the new target onto open deals without the full reload, is gone for the same reason. The bot worker still reloads on save so the next deal uses the new settings, and it now rebuilds its indicator subscriptions when it does: the keep-orders reload path reconciles indicators by symbol alone, so swapping one indicator for another on the same pair would otherwise have left the old one subscribed and never subscribed the new one.

## [1.52.11] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- A deal we decline to re-open is now released instead of holding its symbol. A deal is written before its opening order reaches the venue, so an order refused under Binance's Quantitative Rules leaves the deal in `start` with nothing on the exchange. While the retry loop existed something eventually opened or failed it; now that we correctly stop retrying, nothing did — and an abandoned deal still counts against `max deals per pair`, so it silently swallowed every later signal for that symbol. A deal created during an account-wide restriction could hold its symbol for hours and eat a TradingView signal that arrived long after the restriction had cleared, with many deals on an account left sitting in the same state. Only a deal still in `start` is released — one that has opened, closed or been cancelled is left exactly as it is, so this can never abandon a real position.

## [1.52.10] - 2026-08-23

### Fixed

- A Binance Quantitative Rules restriction no longer re-opens itself. Every order refused during one restriction was scheduled to retry at that restriction's expiry plus one second — the same instant for all of them — so the moment an account-wide window lifted, everything it had blocked fired together: an account could see dozens of opening orders retry, fill and place their take-profits inside a single minute across as many symbols. Binance measures the unfilled ratio per symbol in 10-minute buckets, so a burst of that shape lands placed quantity on dozens of symbols with nothing executed against it, records a violation on each, and ten symbols at once re-opens the account-wide restriction the burst was waiting out — barely a minute after the previous one expired. Retries are now spread across a jitter window, backed off per attempt, capped, and refused outright once a symbol is within a few violations of the level-2 threshold, since our own refused retry is itself a violation. Only a deal started ASAP is retried at all: every other start condition is a point in time, so re-sending it after a restriction lifts opens a trade the original signal never described, and its own trigger will fire again anyway.

## [1.52.9] - 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- A Kraken Futures duplicate-order rejection no longer writes off an order the venue is actually holding. Kraken spells it `clientOrderIdAlreadyExist` with no spaces, so it matched none of the duplicate-recovery variants (OKX's spaced `Client order ID already exists` already did) and fell through to the terminal write-off — which also unregisters the id from the shared stream, so the venue's later fills reach no bot at all. A combo bot on krakenUsdm had a reduce-only SELL written off seconds after it went live on the venue, then filled an hour later — a fill the deal never saw. Both spellings now also classify as `Duplicate order ID` instead of Uncategorized.

## [1.52.8] - 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- The pre-start position check no longer treats a reported leverage of 0 as a mismatch. A connector that cannot state a position's leverage reports 0 — Kraken Futures has no per-position leverage at all (it is a per-contract account preference), and exchange-connector core 1.19.14 reports `'0'` for cross/dynamic or an unreadable preference where it used to hardcode `'1'`. Compared literally, that hardcoded 1 refused to start every Kraken futures bot above 1x into an existing position ("Leverage in active position is 1, but in settings 2") — and users worked around it by dropping bots to 1x. Unknown is not a mismatch; a real isolated leverage still is.

## [1.52.7] - 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- A deal abandoned with an open position is no longer reported as "Deal closed". Stopping a bot whose `stopType` is `leave` cancels the deal's resting orders and deliberately leaves whatever already filled on the exchange, but the bot event still read `Deal closed, id: …, profit: 0$` — so a user who read their event log correctly concluded the deal was finished. It was not: the position stayed on the venue, unmanaged, with no take profit and no stop loss. A futures short was left that way, went unwatched for days, and was liquidated by the venue. A `canceled` deal that still holds volume now names the outcome, the size left behind and that the bot no longer manages it.
- The explicit `leave` close path recorded nothing at all. It cancels the resting orders and returns before `processDealClose`, so a deal left open produced no event and no message anywhere. It now reports the abandoned position as a warning (never an error — leaving a position is what the user asked for, and it must not flip the bot into `error`), under its own `Position left open` subtype so it can be tuned without touching real errors. The throttle is bypassed: stopping two bots in a row has to report both positions.
- A bot blocked by the pre-start position check no longer goes quiet. When `loadData` refuses to start (leverage, margin type or side of an existing venue position disagrees with the settings) the bot is stopped, but no status event was written — the event log's last line stayed `open status is set` while the bot sat closed and never retried. A hedge long leg blocked this way can open no deals for days while looking merely idle, with nothing pointing at the real cause. The transition is now recorded, and says the bot will not retry on its own.

## [1.52.6] - 2026-08-22

### Fixed

- A bot error the user never saw is no longer deleted before they can see it. `restoreFromRangeOrError()` tombstoned every undismissed message on a bot whenever it left `error` status, on the premise that leaving that status meant the condition was gone — but `BotStatusEnum.error` is soft and the bot returns to `open` on the very next cycle whether or not anything was fixed, so the clear ran against live conditions, every cycle. The notifications feed filters on `isDeleted`, so the row vanished from the panel seconds after it was written: a key that could not place an order for days produced a visible message on every cycle, each one tombstoned moments later, and nothing at all in Notifications — the only surviving trace was the bot's Events tab. Recovery now clears the bot's error badge and nothing else; a repeat `$inc`s the one row the user is looking at, as `logMode: 'once'` always intended, and dismissal remains what re-arms the subType.

## [1.52.5] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- `getDataByPriority` now falls back to the OAuth/top-level value when a field is absent from the partial `userDefined` override, so a surname saved to Settings → Personal data survives a reload instead of reading back empty. The `userSettings` mutation also mirrors `lastName` into `userDefined` alongside `name`, and no longer drops `name`/`lastName` when they are deliberately cleared.

## [1.52.4] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- `getBalances` for a futures leg that is `linkedTo` its spot leg (OKX / Bybit unified accounts) now returns the shared balance pool, tagged with the requested leg — the bot form showed "BAL 0" for every such account because balances are only stored under the source leg (seen on OKX Europe X-Perps).

## [1.52.3] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- API-key signatures can no longer be replayed. The `time` header is part of the signed material but was never compared to the clock, so a captured request stayed valid indefinitely and could be replayed verbatim. Requests whose timestamp sits more than five minutes from server time are now rejected before the signature is even computed; `API_SIGNATURE_WINDOW_MS` widens or (at `0`) disables the check. The signature comparison is also constant-time now, so it no longer leaks through timing how many leading bytes a guess got right (GHSA-whmj-5f67-9f3w).
- Session tokens expire. `jsonwebtoken` reads a numeric `expiresIn` as seconds, and this was handed a millisecond epoch — signing an `exp` roughly 56,000 years out, so no session ever expired and any leaked token was permanent access. Minting now goes through a shared `signSessionToken` helper that takes seconds and derives the persisted `expiredAt` from the token's own claims, so the stored row and the enforced expiry cannot disagree. Override the 30-day default with `SESSION_TTL_SECONDS` (GHSA-7gxr-ppgj-jjg8).
- Failed logins return one generic message. The login mutation answered "Password not correct" for a real account and "Sign up Error" for an unknown one, which let anyone sort addresses into those that have accounts and those that do not (GHSA-whmj-5f67-9f3w).
- Credential-bearing GraphQL operations are rate limited. The `/api` REST routes had a limiter; the GraphQL endpoint had none, so the login mutation could be brute-forced at full speed. Ten attempts per minute per address now, applied only to auth operations so ordinary dashboard traffic is untouched — `AUTH_RATE_LIMIT_MAX` adjusts it (GHSA-whmj-5f67-9f3w).

## [1.52.2] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- `cli:reset-password` now signs the account out everywhere as well as changing the password. It only rewrote the password before, so every session stayed valid. Same reasoning as the `changePassword` fix in 1.52.0.

## [1.52.1] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- A closed futures deal now reports the quantity it actually closed. `size` means the live position while a deal is open, but once the position is gone there is nothing left to read it from, so it was back-derived from the deal's usage instead — a different quantity, in the same field. Whether the derived value or the real one ended up stored depended on whether a usage update happened to land after the deal's status flipped, so roughly half of closed futures deals showed one basis and half the other, and `Size × Average Price` did not reconcile with `Notional Value`. The real closed amount — the closing fill plus any earlier partial take-profits — is now recorded when the deal closes and preserved afterwards. Display only: nothing in the engine reads this field.


## [1.52.0] - 2026-08-21

### Changed

- **Changing your password now requires your current password.** `changePasswordInput` gains a required `currentPassword` field, so a session alone is no longer sufficient to set a new password (GHSA-4m6h-m5mj-733x). **This is a breaking API change** — update the dashboard to main-dash-sh 2.45.0 or later in the same upgrade, or the change-password form will stop working.
- Changing your password now signs out every other session on the account, keeping only the one you changed it from. Previously all existing sessions survived a password change.

### Fixed

- The Socket.IO user stream now requires `userId` and `userToken` to be strings before they are used to look a user up, and no longer registers the legacy inbound bot-relay events unless `STREAM_ACCEPT_LEGACY_SOCKET_RELAY=true` is set (GHSA-hmxp-q7gj-rr88). Live updates travel over Redis (`STREAM_TYPE=redis`, the default in `.env.sample`), so the relay events are unused in a standard deployment.

## [1.51.30] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- The not-enough-balance guard is no longer wiped by an ordinary small fill on the same pair, so a recovery order the exchange keeps refusing is finally allowed to back off. The guard counts refusals per (symbol, side), which deliberately puts a combo bot's routine grid orders and its much larger safety/recovery order on one counter, and it retired that counter on any success at least as big as the *smallest* order the venue had ever refused on the key. That floor screens out nothing: once a grid order has been refused a single time during a dip, it sits at grid-order size forever, and every grid fill a few minutes later cleared both the counter and the retry cooldown that only the big order had built. A combo bot could re-send the same recovery order — identical symbol, side, quantity and price, a fresh order id each time — for weeks, arming and losing the guard several times in a few hours. Retiring the guard now takes a success at the *largest* size the venue has refused, and the same rule stops a small affordable order from decaying the counter before it is sent. Suppression still starts at the smallest refused size, so nothing that was being held back is let through.

## [1.51.29] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- Combo futures deals now record the funding they accrue, and their take profit accounts for it. Combo's `createDeal` never seeded the funding cursor its DCA counterpart does, and the per-deal funding write is a compare-and-swap on that cursor — so on a combo deal it matched no document and every write was silently dropped, while closing the deal still subtracted the in-memory funding from the reported profit. Users were left with a profit figure reduced by a real cost and no line anywhere explaining it. Deals already open adopt the cursor on their next settlement instead of having to be reopened, and a combo deal started on a pair the bot was not already holding subscribes to that symbol's funding straight away rather than waiting for the next bot start.
- Combo take-profit and stop-loss targets now include accrued funding. The target is a percentage of the deal's usage, and it previously ignored funding entirely, so a perpetual held long enough for funding to rival that percentage could reach its take profit and still close at a loss. The two directions of the equation — the price that hits a target, and the percentage at a price — had been maintained as two hand-written copies; they now share one implementation, with a test pinning their round-trip and their agreement with the previous formulas when funding is zero.

## [1.51.28] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- A deal whose opening order the exchange refused under a Binance Quantitative Rules cooldown now re-attempts as soon as the cooldown ends, instead of waiting for the periodic order sweep. The retry timer that exists for exactly this — the exchange never saw the order, so nothing in normal running re-places it — was skipped for any caller that asks for the rejection reason back, which is every deal-opening order. A deal could spend hours between its refusal and its next attempt, most of it after the restriction had already expired. The re-attempt re-runs the whole deal-opening sequence rather than re-sending the bare order, because that is what starts the deal on an immediate fill and arms the limit-reposition timers on one that rests; it is keyed on the deal, so repeated refusals collapse onto the single re-open the deal needs instead of accumulating one pending retry per attempt. An opening order held back this way is also no longer left behind as an order the exchange has never heard of. Safety orders and take-profits retry exactly as before.

## [1.51.27] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- A DCA or combo bot whose DCA order spacing scales on ATR or ADR now always carries the ATR/ADR indicator that spacing is computed from, and says so plainly if it ever does not. That indicator is what prices the safety-order ladder, and until now it was only ever created as a side-effect of switching the "Base scaling on" selector in the interface — so a bot saved through the public API, a clone, an AI agent tool, or a form submit that never touched that selector could be stored set to ATR with no indicator behind it. Such a bot could not open a single deal, on any pair, for its entire life: the engine found no levels to place orders at and returned without opening anything, writing no error, no bot message and no event. The bot log simply stopped after "Balance check skipped", the deal never appeared, and because the interface hides the ATR panel when the indicator is missing, the owner could not see or repair the cause either. The indicator is now filled in whenever a bot is created or saved with ATR/ADR scaling, so the combination cannot be stored broken from any path. If a bot still reaches that state, the deal attempt now reports that the ATR/ADR indicator is missing instead of failing silently — while a bot whose indicator is merely still warming up stays quiet, as before.

## [1.51.26] - 2026-08-21

### Fixed

- A `startDeal`, `closeDeal`, `addFunds` or `reduceFunds` webhook sent to a multi-pair DCA bot now accepts the pair written the way the platform itself writes it. The webhook only ever recognised the `BASE_QUOTE` form, so `AAVE_USDT` worked but `AAVEUSDT` and `AAVE-USDT` were both refused with "Symbol AAVE-USDT format is incorrect" and no deal was opened — even though those are exactly the identifiers the bot stores in its own pair list and shows in the interface, compact on Binance and dashed on KuCoin. Users copying a pair out of their own bot settings therefore got a webhook that returned HTTP 200, was logged as received, and then quietly did nothing. The pair is now resolved by matching it against the bot's own configured pairs ignoring separators and case, so the underscore, dashed, compact, slashed and lower-case forms all reach the same pair. The quote asset is never guessed from the text: only pairs already configured on the bot can match, an exact `BASE_QUOTE` match still takes precedence, and a pair that is genuinely not on the bot is still refused.

## [1.51.25] - 2026-08-20

### Fixed

- An order whose response was lost on the way back is no longer either placed twice or written off while it is still live on the exchange. Sending an order could fail with a timeout, a dropped connection or a server error — none of which say whether the exchange actually received it — and the order was then re-sent with the same client order id up to six times. On an exchange that does not reject a repeated client order id, such as Hyperliquid, each re-send opened another real order. The opposite case was worse: when the send finally gave up, the order was recorded as cancelled without ever asking the exchange, and because that also unhooks it from the live fill feed, the exchange's later fills for it reached no bot at all — so the position moved on the exchange and never in the deal, silently, with the take-profit ladder then sized off the wrong position. An order is now sent once, and on any outcome that does not tell us what happened the exchange is asked what it has: if the order is there it is adopted rather than re-sent, and it is only re-sent when the exchange confirms it never arrived. The same question is asked before an order is written off, so an order the exchange is still holding is kept. Genuine exchange rejections — minimum notional, tick size, insufficient funds — are unaffected and still fail immediately.

## [1.51.24] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- A deal that was created but whose opening order the exchange refused now records why, on the deal itself. The deal row is written before that order reaches the exchange, so a refusal left the deal listed with no orders and nothing explaining it; the only trace was a bot-level warning that names neither the deal nor the pair. The deal now carries the exchange's reason, when the restriction is expected to lift where the exchange grades it, and whether it covers one pair or the whole account — available over GraphQL, over `/api/v2/deals/*` at the `standard` field preset, and pushed live to an open dashboard. It is cleared the moment the exchange accepts an opening order, and it changes nothing else: the deal keeps its status and the bot is not put into an error state. That matters most for the Binance Quantitative Rules (-4400) cooldown this was built for, where the whole point of the existing handling is that we stop sending orders rather than escalate the restriction, and the deal opens by itself once the cooldown ends.

## [1.51.23] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- `addExchange` no longer persists one trade type's connections before the next one has been verified. A "Spot & Futures" add whose key lacked the Futures permission saved the Spot leg and then returned an error, so the account kept a connection the user was told had not been created — and the duplicate check then refused every retry with that key. All requested trade types are verified up front, anything a failed attempt already wrote is rolled back, and the duplicate reason names the existing connection and how to clear it.

## [1.51.22] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- The terminal-deal position pre-check no longer skips paper connections. It was written to skip them on the assumption that the engine does; the engine does not. Its `paperExchanges` exclusion guards the margin-type rule and the grid branch only — the side rule fires for `botType === dca` outright, and a terminal deal is a DCA bot. The pre-check was therefore a no-op for exactly the accounts most likely to be driven by an automation on a loop, which is the case it was built for. Paper connections are now checked like any other futures connection.

## [1.51.21] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- Take profit and percentage stop loss are fee-compensated on futures again. Both prices are derived from the deal's average entry and then pushed out far enough to clear the round trip — but the fee that displacement reads is deliberately zeroed on futures, because there the fee is charged against margin and never taken out of the position, so the *quantity* leg must ignore it. The two uses were folded into one value in 1.14.17, and the price leg has been reading the zeroed one since: every futures TP and percentage SL was placed at exactly the configured percentage from average entry, with no allowance for fees. Nothing about that is visible from the outside — the deal closes cleanly and the reported profit is accurate, it is simply smaller than the configured percentage implies, by roughly one round trip. It goes unnoticed at ordinary targets and dominates at small ones, where a tenth of a percent is most of the target. The price leg now reads the venue's real fee, the quantity leg still ignores it on futures, and both are pinned by tests.

## [1.51.20] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- The re-raise cooldown no longer misses one-bot-per-deal patterns. It is keyed per (bot, subType), which is what makes the window mean anything for a bot the user keeps — but a terminal deal is one bot per deal, created by the request that starts it, so the bot id is never the same twice and the cooldown could suppress nothing at all: every occurrence was the first for its bot, and a caller looping on a condition that would not clear collected one notification per attempt. Terminal deals now key the cooldown on the user, the subType and the symbol, which is what identifies the constraint and is stable across the bots.

### Added

- A repeated-refusal breaker on `POST /api/v2/deals/terminal`. The `400` for a position conflict tells an honest caller why, but does nothing about an automation that ignores the answer and re-sends — and each attempt still pays for a credentialed position read on the way to the same refusal, spending the same exchange rate-limit budget as real trading. After three consecutive refusals of the same (user, connection, symbol, kind), the refusal is replayed from Redis as a `429` with `Retry-After` and the read is skipped. The window widens per refusal, caps at 15 minutes, expires on its own, and is cleared by the first deal that goes through, so a user who closes the position recovers with no intervention. Fed only by refusals the endpoint decides itself — never by the engine's asynchronous start failures, some of which are ours.

## [1.51.19] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed

- `POST /api/v2/deals/terminal` no longer answers `200` for a deal the engine is about to refuse. The endpoint created the bot and dispatched it to a worker, where `loadData` rejected the start because a position was already open on the symbol in the opposite direction — after the response had been sent. The caller was told the deal had been created and scheduled, had no object to watch, and never learned otherwise; the abandoned bot was left behind, closed and without deals, once per attempt. The same question is now asked before anything is created, and a conflict comes back as a `400` naming the side already open. The check is conservative by design: only a conflict it can establish rejects, while unreadable positions, a symbol it cannot line up, a hedge account that may legitimately hold both sides, spot deals and paper exchanges all fall through to the engine's own check unchanged.

## [1.51.18] - 2026-08-18

### Security

- DataGrid `contains` / `startsWith` / `endsWith` filters now match the user's value as a literal string. `mapDataGridOptionsToMongoOptions` ran the value through `encodeURIComponent` and fed the result straight to `new RegExp`, but `encodeURIComponent` leaves `.`, `*`, `(` and `)` intact — so the value reached the engine as a pattern rather than a literal. A bare `(` threw a `SyntaxError` and failed the whole query, and a value such as `.*` silently matched every document instead of the substring the operator names promise. Every metacharacter is now escaped. Reported as GHSA-cc5x-49gv-35wr; note the report's denial-of-service impact does not apply — the pattern is serialised into the MongoDB query and evaluated by `mongod`, never matched on the Node event loop.

## [1.51.17] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed

- A bot error the user alone can resolve (an unsigned exchange agreement, a dead API key, a venue restriction) was re-raised on every bot cycle. `logMode: 'once'` caps such a condition at one visible bot message per bot only while that message stays the coalescing target, and for any subType with `errorsBot: true` it never does: `BotStatusEnum.error` is a soft status, so `restoreFromRangeOrError()` clears the bot's messages and `$unset`s their bucket before the next attempt. The condition re-failed, inserted a fresh row, and every occurrence looked like a first occurrence — a new dashboard message and alert each cycle. `processError` now consults a Redis-backed exponential re-raise cooldown per (bot, subType) — same mechanism and 5min→1h ceiling as the compliance/auth/balance guards — and while it is open writes the occurrence into the hidden lane instead. Hidden rows are born `isDeleted`, which is what the recovery clear filters on, so their bucket survives and they coalesce; a counted record is kept either way. User-initiated (`force`) reports are never suppressed, and a Redis failure re-raises as before.

## [1.51.16] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed

- Futures deal take profit placed as a zero-quantity order after a bot worker restart

## [1.51.15] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- Reducing a deal's funds by 100% told the user the reduce order quantity was "more than" a closed order quantity equal to it — an inequality between two equal numbers, followed by a promise the bot does not keep. When the requested reduction covers the whole remaining position there is nothing left to keep, so the deal is closed at market and no reduce order is placed. The warning now says the deal will be closed, and distinguishes a reduction that exactly covers the position from one that exceeds it. Behaviour is unchanged — only the wording.

## [1.51.14] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed

- `/trade_signal` rejects a webhook it can't act on instead of answering 200. `singleWebhookProcess` returned `undefined` whenever no branch matched — an unknown action name, or a known action whose required parameters or bot state were missing — and `webhookProcess` turned that into `StatusEnum.ok`. The caller got a success for a signal that did nothing. It now returns `{status: notok, reason}`, which the route already maps to HTTP 400, naming the action and listing the supported ones.

### Removed

- `enterLong`, `enterShort`, `exitLong` and `exitShort` dropped from `WebhookActionEnum`. No handler was ever written for them, so they were the silent-200 case above in its purest form: advertised by the dashboard, discarded by the engine.

## [1.51.13] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- RPC-latency counters now expose a per-window max (`windowMaxMs`) alongside the cumulative one, so a monitor can report the worst round-trip of a sample window rather than a since-boot high-water mark

## [1.51.12] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- Changing a DCA bot's profit currency no longer re-bases the deals that are already running. A running deal keeps the profit currency it entered with; only deals opened after the change use the new one. Combo bots already behaved this way.

## [1.51.11] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- The backtest callback routes (`/api/serverSideBacktest`, `/api/serverSideBacktestSaveFile`) now authenticate the caller. They sit above the global JWT middleware — deliberately, since the backtest worker calls them host-to-host with no user token — and so need authentication of their own. A build-time literal was not an option here, because this repo is public and such a literal would be both published and identical across every install, so the token is derived per-install from `JWT_SECRET` (override with `INTERNAL_API_SECRET`). Fails closed: with no secret configured, no caller is accepted.

## [1.51.10] - 2026-08-12

### Fixed

- `saveFile` now refuses to write outside `user-files`. The name, extension and subdirectory it receives all arrive from a request body and are all concatenated into a path, so any one of them could walk out of the directory with `../` — the extension included, since it is appended after a dot. Rather than filtering each argument, the resolved directory and the resolved file path are both checked to still be under the root, which also covers whatever argument gets threaded through here next.

## [1.51.9] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- The not-enough-balance guard is now aware of order SIZE, so a bot that keeps a small order filling on the same pair and side as one the exchange refuses no longer hammers the venue forever. The guard counts failures per (symbol, side), but affordability depends on the order's notional: a combo bot's small grid order filled every few minutes on the same key while its much larger safety order was refused, and each of those fills wiped the failure counter and the cooldown the safety order had built up. The counter never survived long enough to engage, so every single retry reached the exchange and raised a "Not enough balance" alert, with the guard left disarmed for hours at a stretch. Orders below the size the venue has actually refused now pass through the guard untouched (the grid keeps trading), and only a success at or above that size clears it. The failure counter's arm and trip thresholds were also one apart, which let every second attempt slip past the guard.

## [1.51.8] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- An order the exchange never accepted is no longer re-checked against the exchange five times before the bot gives up on it. Such an order carries a placeholder instead of an exchange order id, so "the exchange does not know this order" is the final answer the first time it is given — waiting ~15 seconds to ask four more times cannot change it. A Kraken Futures combo bot holding dozens of grid orders that had been refused for insufficient funds days earlier cost hundreds of exchange calls and many minutes of errors when they were re-checked after a restart. Checks that fail for any other reason — a timeout, a rate limit — still get the full retry ladder, as do orders that do hold a real exchange order id.

## [1.51.7] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- The not-enough-balance cooldown now opens on any real venue rejection once the failure counter has tripped, instead of only when our own balance figures also agreed the order was unaffordable. `required` is one order's bare notional while the venue prices the whole safety-order ladder plus its fees, so the two disagree — a Kraken Futures bot was refused `insufficientAvailableFunds` for an order smaller than the venue's OWN reported available margin, and that disagreement was the one case that never backed off. The cooldown is also consulted whichever way the balance comparison falls, so the window it opens actually suppresses: a long run of rejected orders becomes a handful.

## [1.51.6] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- `getActiveOrders()` now honours the exchange auth-failure cooldown, like `checkAssets()` already did. Gating only the balance call left the combo open-a-deal path re-asking a dead API key once per minute — hundreds of rejections in a few hours on one bot — while the balance path was correctly backed off to hourly.

## [1.51.5] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed

- `setStatus(..., ignoreErrors)` now forwards the flag to `stop()`. `stop()` assigns `this.ignoreErrors = ignoreErrors` (default `false`) as its first statement, so calling it without the argument wiped the flag `setStatus` had just set and every caller asking to close a bot quietly was ignored. Both the DCA/combo and the grid helper are affected.
- `resetUser` marks its own bot teardown as errors-to-ignore, except for `softLive` which deletes nothing. It closes the account's bots and then deletes their paper user milliseconds later, while the workers are still cancelling — paper-trading answers `400 User not found` and the bot filed it as a user-visible error on a bot that no longer exists. `changeStatus` carries the new `input.ignoreErrors` through to the grid/DCA/combo workers.

## [1.51.4] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- `getAccountFills()` on the exchange layer — read-only access to the venue's own execution history, for reconciling what a venue actually did against what we recorded. Distinct from `getTrades`, which is the public tape for a symbol. Returns an empty list for every venue publishing no such feed and for the paper simulator, whose fills we already own in full.

## [1.51.3] - 2026-08-08

### Added

- Balance records now keep `venueAvailable`, the venue's own figure for how much of an asset is spendable, whenever the user stream publishes one. The field is optional and stays **absent** when the venue reports nothing — absent means unknown, not zero, and a stored zero would read as "none of this balance is spendable". On a pooled cross-collateral account (Kraken Futures' flex account) `free`/`locked` cannot express what the venue has committed, so `free - venueAvailable` is the only continuously-available signal that an account holds a position the engine is not tracking — which is otherwise invisible until an order is rejected.

## [1.51.2] - 2026-08-08

### Fixed

- Kraken USDⓈ-M Futures bots no longer latch into "Not enough balance" on an account that has funds. Kraken's flex account pools every collateral currency into one cross-margin pool, so the per-asset `free`/`locked` split in the cached `balances` doc cannot represent anything the venue enforces — and its two writers derived one anyway, in opposite directions, so the stored figure meant whichever write landed last. The not-enough-balance latch read that figure and broke both ways: on the wallet-quantity convention it cleared the latch and sent an order the venue then refused for insufficient funds; on the other it suppressed every order from then on, with no way back, because the cached number could never rise above the required amount. The latch now confirms against the venue's own `availableMargin` before clearing, and the error message reports that same figure instead of a wallet total the venue will not let the bot spend. The venue is consulted only for a bot that is already in the failing regime — never on the healthy order path — and every non-pooled venue keeps the existing cached-balance behaviour unchanged.

## [1.51.1] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed

- A stop loss that "move SL" had already pushed into profit no longer closes a deal at a loss. Once the move fires, the deal's stop sits on the profit side of the average entry and can only be reached on the way back from profit — but the check only compared the price to the stop level, so as soon as the market ran past that level the wrong way (safety orders pulling the average through it), the very next tick closed the deal at market. Deals on a short bot were closed at a loss this way. The stop now only triggers while the deal is still on the profit side of its entry; ordinary loss-side stops are unaffected.

## [1.51.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added

- An application embedding this package can now own how a stored credential is written, not only how it is read. With nothing registered, credentials are written exactly as before.

## [1.50.3] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Orders that never received an exchange order id are no longer looked up on the exchange. On Coinbase, Kraken and KuCoin full futures an order can only be fetched by the id the venue assigns it, and until that id arrives the order carries a placeholder — which was being sent as if it were a real id. Every check of such an order cost two futile exchange calls and an error line; a grid bot re-checking a batch of them on each stream reconnect produced dozens of exchange errors in a minute. The checks now answer immediately, with the same verdict the exchange was giving.

## [1.50.2] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Recognise two more ways an exchange says a position is already closed, so those deals finish instead of being retried on every restart. Rejections are now matched on letters and digits alone, so a venue wording the same condition as a code rather than a sentence is still understood.

## [1.50.1] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Order quarantine could count a freshly-placed order against itself. Some exchanges answer "unknown order id" for an order they were handed moments ago — that is the exchange describing its own propagation lag, not a missing order. A not-found now only counts once the order has gone untouched for `BOT_ORDER_QUARANTINE_MIN_AGE_MS` (default 24h); an order with no usable timestamp is never counted at all.
- Quarantine strikes are now genuinely consecutive, as documented. A successful lookup clears them, including on the common path where a resting order comes back unchanged and is not written back — previously strikes accumulated for the life of an order, so three unrelated blips months apart could quarantine a live one.

### Added

- Hyperliquid's `unknownOid` is now recognised as a definitive not-found, so its stale orders stop being re-probed on every restart. Safe only in combination with the age floor above, because Hyperliquid uses that same answer for both a long-gone order and a just-placed one.

## [1.50.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added

- Orders the exchange repeatedly reports as non-existent are now put in a polling quarantine instead of being re-checked forever. An order that has been gone for months used to cost a failed lookup on every single restart — on venues that sleep-and-retry before admitting an order is missing, that is tens of seconds each. After `BOT_ORDER_QUARANTINE_STRIKES` (default 3) separate checks each get a definitive "no such order" from the exchange, the bot stops asking. Set `0` to disable.
- Quarantine only ever stops the bot *asking* about an order — it never stops the bot *hearing* about one. A quarantined order stays subscribed to the live order stream, stays in the bot's order list, and is still cancelled when the bot stops. If the exchange mentions it again for any reason, the quarantine is dropped immediately. Restarting the bot re-checks everything, so there is always a way back.

### Fixed

- A failed order lookup no longer discards the exchange's explanation. "This order does not exist", "the request timed out" and "you are rate limited" were all collapsed into the same message, because the branch that read the reason was unreachable — which is why nothing could tell a genuinely missing order from a temporarily unreachable exchange. Only the first of those now counts towards quarantine.

## [1.49.4] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- A single bot can no longer stretch a service restart by minutes. The restart-time order check asks the exchange about each open order one at a time, so a bot holding orders the venue no longer recognises paid the full failed-lookup cost for every one of them while the rest of the fleet waited. That check now has a per-bot time budget (`BOT_RESTART_PROBE_BUDGET_MS`, default 60s, `0` disables): once it is spent the bot stops probing and the orders are left to the user stream, the reconcile sweep and the fill-failsafe, which already own that job. Normal running behaviour is unchanged — the budget only arms during a service restart.

## [1.49.3] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Cancelling a Combo deal no longer discards the profit it had already made. A Combo deal banks profit as each minigrid round-trip completes, but cancelling one credited nothing to the bot's total or to the profit history — the amount stayed visible on the deal and was counted nowhere else. Cancelling a deal that never traded is unchanged.

## [1.49.2] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- A deal that started closing and did not finish stayed frozen after a restart: the "closing now" markers were restored from the cache as if the close were still running, so the bot refused to place orders for that deal and the close was never retried. They are now cleared on load, matching what the database load path already did.

## [1.49.1] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Hedge bots now look their sibling leg up through an index instead of walking the whole bot collection, on every start, restart and close.

## [1.49.0] - 2026-08-06

### Changed

- Stored exchange and API credentials are now recovered through a single asynchronous module rather than at each call site, so an installation can keep them in a format only the host application is able to unwrap.

## [1.48.2] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- Reading a host-managed stored value through the synchronous path now fails loudly instead of returning an empty string. It previously fell through to AES, which does not signal failure on that input — the caller received `''` and used it as the credential, producing an authentication failure at the exchange with no exception anywhere.

## [1.48.4] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- An order held back by one of the local safeguards no longer leaves a cancelled-order record behind. Each attempt is issued under its own order id, so every held-back retry was filing a fresh record for an order that was never placed anywhere — these accounted for a large share of all stored orders. Orders that genuinely reached the exchange are recorded exactly as before.

## [1.48.3] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- The marker recording which scheme a bot's not-enough-balance counters were written under was not declared on the stored bot, so it was silently dropped every time the bot saved. The one-time clean-up it guards therefore ran again on every restart, clearing the counters and making the safeguard re-arm from scratch — which costs a handful of pointless exchange calls per stuck order each time a worker restarts. Confirmed in the field, where the marker read as absent on a bot whose counters had plainly been migrated.

## [1.48.2] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- A hedge bot whose paired bot had been deleted crashed while restarting, silently: it never came back, never reported in, and failed the same way on every subsequent restart.

## [1.48.1] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- The count of bots that failed to come back after a restart was measured at the wrong moment and from the wrong place, so it reported every bot as missing even when all of them returned. It is now measured once the restart has had time to settle, and counts what the bot workers actually reported.

## [1.48.0] - 2026-08-06

### Changed

- A repeating bot error now updates one message and counts the repeats, instead of writing a new message every time it happens. The error list shows how many times a condition fired and when it first did, rather than the same error over and over.
- How often a given error is allowed to write a new message is now set per error type in configuration, and takes effect within five minutes without restarting anything.
- Errors that are suppressed from users were being recorded on every single occurrence — they are now recorded once an hour by default, as they always should have been.
- Notifications and alerts for a repeating error are sent when it first happens, not on every repeat.

### Fixed

- Bot messages that a user has dismissed are now cleaned up after 30 days instead of being kept forever.
- Two internal error paths recorded messages under names that the classification system did not know about, so they could not be categorised or configured. They now go through the normal path.

## [1.47.0] - 2026-08-06

### Fixed

- A bot service that could not finish bringing every bot back after a restart would never begin accepting commands again, for as long as it kept running. Start, stop and edit requests for that bot type then sat unanswered until they timed out. The service now starts accepting commands once the bots are back, and also when the restart has clearly stopped making progress — in which case it says so loudly rather than going quiet.

### Added

- Restart telemetry: how long the bot lookup took, how long each bot took to come back, the slowest bots of the restart, and which bots never reported back — so a slow restart can be explained instead of guessed at.
- The wait for a reply from a bot service is now configurable rather than fixed at five minutes.

## [1.46.0] - 2026-08-05

### Changed

- The two separate cooldowns added for rejections that cannot succeed on retry — a permanent jurisdiction restriction, and an order the account cannot fund — now share one mechanism. Both hold the order back for a spell that widens each time the exchange rejects again, and both reset the moment the order goes through. Previously only one of them backed off, and the other kept its state in memory, so it was lost whenever a bot moved between workers or restarted; the shared version keeps it where every worker can see it.
- A jurisdiction restriction that the account holder resolves is now picked up within about five minutes instead of up to an hour, while one that is never resolved settles at the same hourly re-check as before.

## [1.45.1] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- Bots that could not fund an order kept asking the exchange to place it, over and over, instead of backing off. The safeguard meant to stop this counted failures per order price, but most orders are market orders carrying the live price, so consecutive retries were each filed under a new price and the count never built up to the point where the safeguard engaged. Failures are now counted per asset and direction — which is what a balance shortfall actually applies to — so the safeguard arms as intended. Once it does, the bot re-checks with the exchange on a widening interval rather than continuously, so a shortfall that clears is picked up quickly while one that persists stops generating traffic.
- The failure count is now capped. It previously grew without limit, and since a recovered balance only walks it back one step at a time, a long-running shortfall could leave a bot unable to clear the count and resume on its own.
- Counters recorded under the previous scheme are discarded the first time a bot records a new one, so stale entries no longer accumulate on the bot indefinitely.

## [1.45.0] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- A bot whose exchange account is barred from trading a pair for compliance reasons (for example Kraken refusing USDT pairs to residents of certain countries) kept re-sending the same order to the exchange every few minutes — one account could produce dozens of rejected attempts in a few hours. That block is permanent until the account holder resolves it, so the order is now held back for up to an hour after each rejection instead of being retried. Nothing else changes: the bot reports the same error and the same status as before, and orders that close a position are never held back.

## [1.44.2] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- Hedge bots stayed silent after their first warning or error of a given kind. Recovering from an error clears a bot's active messages so the next occurrence can be shown again, but for hedge bots that clean-up looked under the individual leg while the messages are filed under the parent, so it never found them and the bot never spoke up again. Completes the fix in 1.43.4, which stopped the opposite problem — the same message repeating without end. Existing stuck messages clear themselves the next time the bot recovers from an error.

## [1.44.1] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- Exchange requests no longer pay a scheduling delay when no credential resolver is registered. The resolution step was awaited unconditionally, and awaiting a function that returns immediately still yields to the event loop, so every request paid for a step that had nothing to do — and any timing measured around it reported event-loop lag rather than real work.

## [1.44.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Optional hook letting the host application supply its own way of reading a stored credential, for value formats this package does not define. Nothing is registered by default, so every existing installation is unaffected.
- Exchange request telemetry now records how long resolving that request's credentials took, so the cost is attributable instead of showing up as unexplained drift in the total.

### Fixed

- Reading a stored value whose format this package does not recognise now fails loudly instead of returning an empty string. It previously fell through to AES under the fallback key, which does not signal failure — the caller received `''` and used it as the credential, surfacing as an authentication failure at the exchange with no exception anywhere.

## [1.43.4] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- Hedge bots no longer repeat the same warning or error indefinitely. Every message a hedge bot's legs raise is filed under the parent bot, but the check that decides "this one is already showing, don't post it again" looked under the leg instead, so it never found the existing message and posted every occurrence. A single repeating condition could therefore bury a user in identical notifications. Non-hedge bots were unaffected.

## [1.43.3] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- Broker-code indexes no longer fail to rebuild when several services start at the same time. Each process dropped the collection's indexes before rebuilding them, so a process starting a moment later wiped an index another one was still building and that build aborted. The drop was a leftover from a one-off migration that has since completed; the index sync that follows it already reconciles any change on its own, so indexes are now left alone unless they actually differ.

## [1.43.2] - 2026-08-05

### Changed

- Connecting Hyperliquid without an approved builder fee now explains which approval is missing and how to grant it, instead of asking the user to "follow the instructions" without naming them.

## [1.43.1] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Once a self-hosted installation has an encryption key of its own, the credentials already stored under the previous key are re-encrypted automatically. The api notices on startup that values are still under the old key and moves them in the background; it serves traffic throughout, does nothing once there is nothing left to move, and only ever runs in the api process. The manual command is unchanged and still available — set `ENCRYPT_KEY_AUTO_BACKFILL=false` to use it instead.

## [1.43.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added

- Bots on pooled-collateral futures accounts can now open deals funded by collateral held in another currency. Kraken Futures pools every collateral currency into one cross-margin account, so a wallet funded in EUR shows no USD balance at all — and since order sizing reads the pair's quote asset, such an account was rejected with "Not enough balance to start new deal ... available: 0 USD" even though the venue would have margined the position off the EUR without complaint. When, and only when, the ordinary quote-asset check has already failed, the balance check now asks the connector for the account's pooled USD margin and sizes off that instead. The common path is unchanged and costs no extra request; a venue reporting no pooled margin — every non-pooled exchange, the paper simulator, and any failed call — keeps the previous behaviour exactly, and the pooled figure is trusted only when USD really is the quote asset. Applies to DCA and combo bots.

## [1.42.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Self-hosted installations can now use their own encryption key for the exchange API credentials their users store. Setting `ENCRYPT_KEY` makes new credentials encrypt under it; a new `cli:rotate-encrypt-key` command re-encrypts what is already stored, is safe to run while bots trade, and resumes if interrupted. Values written under the previous key stay readable throughout, so an installation can upgrade first and migrate later.
- The application now says so at startup when no encryption key of its own is configured, and tells the operator how to set one.
- The API can report whether an encryption key is configured, so the dashboard can recommend setting one. It answers yes or no and nothing else.

## [1.41.7] - 2026-08-05

### Fixed

- DCA bots could fail to build their deal orders instead of skipping the attempt. Two cases: when the exchange price lookup failed the price arrived as 0, which made the base quantity infinite — the bot logged a "Big number error" and still produced a take-profit order with an unusable quantity. And a bot scaling its safety orders by ATR/ADR with no "start DCA" indicator configured crashed outright while calculating the second safety order. Both now stop cleanly: a missing price is reported as "Latest price is 0" and no orders are generated, and the ATR/ADR case simply produces no safety orders as it already intended.

## [1.41.6] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed

- Using "reduce funds" more than once on the same DCA deal could close the whole deal instead of shrinking it. Each completed reduction is already recorded on the deal, and the take-profit sizing was subtracting it a second time from the filled sell orders it also counted — so the remaining position it calculated shrank twice as fast as the real one and eventually went negative. Once that number fell below the amount being withdrawn, the bot decided the withdrawal was larger than the position and closed the deal at market. On a reported deal the remaining position was computed as a negative number instead of the base still held. Completed reductions are now counted once, so repeated reductions size correctly and the deal stays open. Deals that never used reduce funds are unaffected.

## [1.41.5] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- Exchange request timing can now record which connector instance served the request

## [1.41.4] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Disconnecting an exchange connection could hang the request for minutes, and when it did, the account's fee, balance and per-exchange snapshot records were left behind with no way to clear them. Telling the running bots to close waited for each worker to acknowledge, using a one-shot listener that fired on whatever the worker said next — and a worker runs many bots, all reporting on the same channel, so an unrelated bot's event consumed the acknowledgement and the wait never ended; a bot whose worker had already been restarted never returned either. The wait now matches the reply it is actually waiting for, gives up after a bounded time across the whole disconnect instead of stalling on one bot, and the close is still delivered either way. The sweep that finds those bots is also now scoped to the account being disconnected, so it uses an index instead of reading every bot in the collection (same bots matched). Finally, a bot service that fails to answer no longer aborts the rest of the disconnect: the connection's fees, balances and snapshots are cleaned up regardless, and the failure is logged.

## [1.41.3] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- The bot-message view read every bot message in the database on each load. It is the only reader of that collection that filters by a date range and sorts newest-first without narrowing to a single user or bot — and no index covered the message timestamp, so the query had no usable plan and fell back to a full collection scan before joining usernames onto the handful it actually returned. The scan was slow enough that a wide date range could also exhaust the sort memory limit and leave the view empty. Adding a timestamp index lets the query seek straight to the requested window and read the rows already in sort order: the query examines tens of documents instead of scanning the collection, with an identical result set. The one index serves both the default view and the "include hidden" view, and the results shown are unchanged.

## [1.41.2] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Zero-priced markets in an exchange's ticker table silently forced a balance to $0.00, which left 1.41.1's fiat rates unreachable on the venue that motivated them. Exchanges list inactive markets at price 0 — Kraken Futures publishes `EUR-USD` at 0 — and `findUSDRate` takes the first pair matching the base/quote it wants, so that dead entry shadowed every later source: the fiat rate, the BTC cross, and the tokenized-stock fallback all became unreachable, and the holding valued at zero. Both valuation paths now drop non-positive and non-finite prices when building the rate table, so a dead market is treated as absent rather than as an authoritative price of nothing.

## [1.41.1] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- Fiat held as collateral (EUR, GBP, CHF, JPY, CAD, AUD) valued at $0.00 in the portfolio. Balances are priced in USD from the exchange's own ticker table, but a multi-collateral venue such as Kraken Futures publishes only its perpetual contracts (`PF_*`) there — no fiat pair exists to price against, so the lookup scored the holding zero. An account funded entirely in fiat therefore reported a total portfolio value of $0.00 and empty allocation charts, which reads as a broken exchange connection even though the balance itself was fetched correctly. The twice-daily rate job now also caches fiat→USD rates from Kraken's public ticker (the same source already used for USDT→USD) and both valuation paths — the portfolio snapshot cron and the on-request pricing helper — expose them under the `all` exchange, so fiat is valued like any other asset. Rates are stored pre-normalized to "1 unit = X USD", so pairs Kraken quotes with USD as the base (USD/JPY, USD/CHF, USD/CAD) are inverted once at write time rather than at every read; a pair that fails to fetch keeps its previous rate instead of dropping to zero until the next run.

## [1.41.0] - 2026-08-03

### Changed

- User passwords are now stored as bcrypt hashes instead of the reversible AES helper in `utils/crypto`. Previously a password could be decrypted back to plaintext with the shared key, so anyone who obtained a copy of the database obtained every password; a bcrypt hash cannot be reversed. The change is dual-read and needs no flag day: existing accounts still sign in normally and are silently rehashed on their next successful login, while sign-up, password change and the `cli:reset-password` utility write bcrypt from the start. An installation converts itself as its users log in — no downtime, no forced reset. New helper at `utils/password.ts`; adds a `bcryptjs` dependency (pure JavaScript, so it needs no native build step in the container image).

### Fixed

- `changePassword`'s "your new password is the same as your current one" check compared by decrypting the stored value, which cannot work once a password is a one-way hash. It now compares correctly, and does so for both stored formats.

## [1.40.5] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- `deleteExchange` awaited seven independent cleanup legs one at a time and filtered three of them so they could not use an index. The `linkedTo` clear, `stopBotByExchange`, `unassignBotByExchange`'s three `updateMany`s and the fee/balance/snapshot `deleteMany`s each waited for the one before it; `feeDb`/`balanceDb`/the bot collections were filtered on `exchangeUUID` alone, but those collections are indexed `{userId, exchangeUUID, …}`, so every disconnect COLLSCANned `fees`, `balances`, `dcaBots`, `comboBots` and `bots` in full — cost scaling with the platform, not the account. The independent legs now run under `Promise.all` (the shape `resetAccount` already uses) and every sweep carries `userId`, which is index-seekable and matches the same rows. Serial depth 7 → 2; `unassignBotByExchange` takes an optional `userId`.

## [1.40.4] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- `npm run lint` failed on a clean checkout, so husky's pre-commit hook rejected every commit. `getLatestOrders`' order filter was hoisted into a `const` so the page read and the count could share it, which dropped its contextual type and widened `status: 'FILLED'` to `string`; that broke `readData`'s `isArray` overload resolution and cascaded into 5 `tsc` errors. Annotated the literal with `OrderStatusType`.

## [1.40.3] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- `probeConnectionState`'s `PROBE_TIMEOUT_MS` was aliased to `VERIFY_TIMEOUT_MS`, so the accounts page's live re-probe of an ALREADY-STORED connection got `addExchange`'s full 30s budget. Every one of its timeouts resolves to the stored reading, so a wedged venue held `updateStatus` (which fans the probes out with `Promise.all`) for 30s to return a value it already had. Decoupled to its own 6s cap, and the timeout warn now names the connection's `provider` and `uuid` so the wedged venue is identifiable.

## [1.40.2] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed

- Every orphan sweep in `premanenetlyDeleteBots` converted `botId` with `$toObjectId`, which throws on the `'system'` sentinel platform notices use, so the aggregation failed and — because each step returns on its first error — aborted every remaining cleanup after it. The sweeps now start from a `$convert`/`onError: null` guard that both keeps the aggregation alive and keeps sentinel rows out of the orphan set.

## [1.40.1] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- `updateStatus` ran each connection's `verify` and `getHedge` serially and persisted a transport failure as a verdict, so one unreachable venue both stalled the accounts page and wrote `status:false`/`hedge:false` over healthy stored connections. Added `probeConnectionState` (concurrent pair, 30s cap, falls back to the stored reading) and an `unreachable` flag on `VerifyResponse` marking "no answer" as distinct from "bad keys".

## [1.40.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- `rotationFlag` on a user's exchange connections, marking a credential an operator has asked the user to replace, and `rotationRequired` on the exchange GraphQL type so the dashboard can show it. The flag clears from `editExchange`'s existing `credentialsChanged` signal, so a rename or a re-verify never counts as a rotation. Unused unless an operator sets it.

## [1.39.3] - 2026-08-01

### Fixed

- The API-key rejection message named the wrong capability. `withdrawalRejectionReason()` infers what to say from the `permissions` it is given, and the self-hosted add/edit-exchange resolvers never passed them — so every rejection read "permission to transfer funds between accounts" and offered a Bybit-specific instruction, even when the key was rejected for withdrawal on Kraken or Hyperliquid. Both resolvers now pass the observed permissions, and the message itself no longer infers one capability from the absence of the other: with no permissions it says only that the key can move funds, and the Bybit hint is offered on Bybit alone. The rejection log lines now record which capability was found.

## [1.39.2] - 2026-07-31

### Security

- Reject new API keys that can move funds between accounts, not just keys that can withdraw. Bybit's Account/Subaccount Transfer can move balances between a user's own accounts with no withdrawal scope; Gainium calls no transfer endpoint on any exchange, so the permission is never needed. Existing connections are still only flagged, never rejected.
- Rejection message now names the capability found and, for transfer, the exact exchange control to untick.

## [1.39.1] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- Indicators service `serviceLog` listener no longer throws on messages without a `.restart` field. `serviceLog` is a shared bus, and `redisServiceLogListener` cast the payload to `{restart: string}` and called `.startsWith()` on it unchecked, so every `priceConnectorAlive` beacon (websocket-connector ≥ 1.13.7, once per beacon interval — deliberately omits `.restart`), `userStreamFlap` and `userStreamAuthReject` produced a "Failed to parse message … TypeError" error line. Now type-guarded before the string call, mirroring the other consumers (`src/indicators/service.ts:processServiceLog`, `src/bot/main.ts`). Behaviour for `botService*` restarts is unchanged; only the throw becomes a no-op. Backport of the cloud-side fix shipped in main-app 2.57.2, which never reached this repo. Noise only — no functionality was lost, but the spurious error lines buried real ones.

## [1.39.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- Withdrawal-permission policy for exchange API keys (`src/exchange/keyPermissionPolicy.ts`). Gainium only ever needs read + trade, and withdrawal is never required by any feature; until now nothing verified that a stored key was actually limited that way. A key that can withdraw is now refused when it is newly supplied (add, or edit-with-new-credentials), and merely recorded on every other path — re-verification never rejects, so existing users' live bots are unaffected.
- `ExchangeInUser.keyPermissions` persists the last observed withdrawal / internal-transfer / IP-allowlist state (plus its timestamp) and is exposed on the `exchangeResponseData` GraphQL type. Declared in the Mongoose user schema — without that, every write would be silently dropped.
- `fetchKeyPermissions()` calls the connector's read-only `GET /keyPermissions` so a periodic audit can refresh the flags without running a verification that could alter a connection's status.


## [1.38.1] - 2026-07-31

### Fixed

- `verifyNormal` and `bybitAccountType` now carry a 30s axios timeout. Both go out with `sendtoall=true`, and the balancer fans those over its connector hosts serially at 5 minutes each, so with no timeout on our side one wedged connector could park an interactive `addExchange` for minutes. A verify timeout now returns a curated "the exchange did not respond in time" reason rather than falling through to the caller's generic "API keys not valid" text.

## [1.38.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added

- OKX Europe X-Perp futures (Phase 2 of the OKX-EU work): `getAccountFuturesExchangeInfo()` exchange-client counterpart, `updateOkxEuPerpPairs()` keyless cron refresh of the X-Perp universe into `pairs` as `source: 'my'` (real + paper ids), and `updateOkxEuSpotApproxPairs()` — a keyless EUR/USDC spot approximation that seeds EU spot until a real my.okx.com account connects (tracked via the new `approx` pair flag, never overwrites real data). EU futures adds now create only the Linear leg (the EU venue has no inverse product). Contributed by a community member.

### Fixed

- X-Perp pair symbols (`BASE-QUOTE_UM_XPERP`) no longer get torn apart by legacy `BASE_QUOTE` split parsing in deal-start pair validation, bot pair checks, the v2 create-bot validators, and server-side backtest pair resolution (community contribution).
- `updateOkxEuPairs()` now takes plaintext keys and encrypts internally — passing already-encrypted keys corrupted the passphrase on decrypt (community contribution).

## [1.37.12] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- **The notifications feed still took up to 18 seconds for accounts with a very large message history, even after the index added in 1.37.9.** That index removed the in-memory sort but left `paperContext` and `isDeleted` as filters Mongo could only apply after loading each document, so the feed still read every message the account had ever received — and then read them all a second time to produce the total. On a seeded 801,949-message account the live feed examined all 801,949 documents to return 2 rows (11.0s), and the paper feed returned 793,679 rows / 308MB of JSON in 22.7s to fill a panel that shows 20. Both filters are now written as exact value lists rather than "not equal" / "does not exist" tests, which lets a new index cover them while still supplying the newest-first order: the live feed drops to 2 documents examined and about 10ms, the paper feed to ~250ms.
- The feed's default load, which the dashboard sends with no paging parameters at all (including the navbar mount that only wants unread counts), was **unbounded** — it fetched and serialised the account's entire message history. It is now capped well above what the panel can display, so smaller accounts are byte-for-byte unchanged.
- The accompanying total is capped the same way instead of counting every matching message, which was on its own about a third of the delay. Accounts above the cap now report the cap rather than an exact figure; the current dashboard does not display this value, and the legacy notifications page uses it only to size its pager.

## [1.37.11] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed

- **Live indicators stopped receiving realtime candles after every price-connector restart and only recovered when the indicators process itself restarted.** Candle subscriptions live only in the connector's memory, so it broadcasts `{restart:'priceConnector'}` on `serviceLog` to make consumers re-request them — but that publish never actually went out (fixed connector-side in websocket-connector-sh 1.13.7), and even when it does, Redis pub/sub gives no delivery guarantee. A consumer that misses it stays subscribed to a channel nobody publishes to, invisibly: `checkCandle` keeps back-filling each close from the archive, so indicator values still look plausible while realtime intra-candle updates are gone. `processServiceLog` now also tracks the connector's boot id from its repeating `priceConnectorAlive` beacon and re-requests when the id changes, so a lost broadcast self-heals within a beacon interval. A first-seen beacon only adopts the id — the subscription was just armed, and `candlesRequests` is a durable queue, so a request sent while the connector was down is delivered on its return. The boot id also rides on the broadcast itself so the broadcast and the beacon that follows it don't both re-request.

## [1.37.10] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- **The "latest orders" list took seconds to load for accounts with a long trading history.** `getLatestOrders` asks for the 10 newest filled orders — `{userId, status:'FILLED', paperContext}` sorted newest-first — but the only usable index was `userId` alone, so Mongo read every order the account had ever filled and sorted them in memory to hand back 10 rows. On a seeded 1.38M-document collection that is a 3.6s blocking sort examining 1,140,000 documents, and in the field it produced repeated multi-second slow-query warnings. A `{userId, updateTime:-1}` index restricted to `status:'FILLED'` lets the sort come straight from the index: 12 documents examined and ~15ms. The index is deliberately partial — `updateTime` moves while an order is still working, but an order is frozen once it fills, so entries are written once and never shuffle, and the busy `NEW`/`PARTIALLY_FILLED` writes never touch the index at all (measured no write cost versus having no index at all). `paperContext` is intentionally not part of the key — the live-context filter is `{$ne: true}`, a range rather than an equality, which would stop `updateTime` from supplying the sort order.
- The same list also counted **every** filled order on the account just to show a total that is capped at 100 — on its own a 3-8s query, and the larger half of the delay. `countData` now takes an optional ceiling, and the count runs alongside the page fetch rather than after it.

## [1.37.9] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- **The notifications feed took seconds to load for accounts with a lot of bot messages.** `getMessageBot` filters bot messages by `{userId, showUser}` and always sorts newest-first, but the only usable index was `userId` alone — so Mongo fetched every message the account had ever received and sorted them in memory. On a large message collection with a heavy account that is a blocking sort for the default feed, and every one of the account's messages is read to produce a single 20-row page. A `{userId, showUser, created:-1}` index lets the sort come straight from the index. `paperContext` is intentionally not part of the key — the live-context filter is `{$ne: true}`, a range rather than an equality, which would stop `created` from supplying the sort order.
- Searching the notifications feed with "unread only" active also returned already-deleted messages: the search filter overwrote the `$or` holding the unread clause instead of being combined with it. Both clauses are now `$and`-ed together.

## [1.37.8] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- **Hyperliquid indicators on live bots silently received no candle data.** For HL exchanges the indicator service subscribed to Redis — and asked websocket-connector — by the pair's *wire code* (`BTC@hyperliquidLinear@1hCandle`), a dialect the connector stopped speaking in Jul 2026 when it normalized candle channels to display pairs: the `candlesRequests` payload failed symbol translation and was dropped, and nothing publishes on wire-code channels. Paper HL bots were unaffected — the pairs-map lookup misses on the paper exchange key, so they always fell back to the display pair, which works. Indicators now always subscribe and request by display pair; `symbolCode` is kept for delisted-pair matching and state dumps only.

## [1.37.7] - 2026-07-28

### Changed

- On-demand balance refresh now fetches a user's exchanges through a bounded worker pool instead of one at a time. Sequentially, a 15-exchange live account paid the sum of every venue round trip (~590ms each, ~9.8s total); the pool collapses that to roughly the slowest venue per wave. Concurrency is `BALANCE_FETCH_CONCURRENCY` (default 8, set to 1 to restore the old sequential behaviour). The all-users snapshot cron deliberately stays sequential per user — it already runs every user in parallel, so fanning out there would multiply peak load on exchange-balancer.
- A venue that throws mid-refresh no longer aborts the remaining exchanges; the failure is logged per exchange and the rest still update.

## [1.37.6] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- Portfolio "refresh balances" / paper top-up no longer takes 30-40s. The snapshot's per-exchange zero-out loop iterated every balance doc the user owns (all exchanges, both contexts) and issued a sequential no-op `updateOne` for each nonzero doc belonging to a *different* exchange — ~11k wasted round trips for a 35-exchange account. The loop now only considers the current exchange's docs, and the reported-asset lookup is a Set instead of a per-doc array scan.

### Added

- `updateBalance` GraphQL query accepts an optional `uuid` to re-fetch only one exchange's balances from the venue (snapshot totals still recompute from stored balances). Used by the dashboard's per-exchange refresh and the paper top-up dialog.
- Compound index `{userId, exchangeUUID, asset}` on `balances` — every balance write filters on exactly these keys and previously scanned all of a user's docs via the bare `userId` index.

## [1.37.5] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- The check-candle failure streak is now tracked per `symbol@interval@exchange` instead of per indicator Service, so one delisted pair costs a fixed 3 error lines + 1 mute line no matter how many Services ride it. `getId` keys a Service by type+config+exchange+symbol+interval, so a single pair carries one Service per distinct indicator setting subscribed on it — and each kept its own counter, multiplying the "log the first few" allowance by the instance count. One delisted pair, carried by many stale Services, dominated the indicator worker's error log, hiding every other error including real regressions on live symbols. A new Service for an already-muted pair now inherits the mute and the backoff instead of re-arming both. Completes 1.37.4, which stopped the streak re-arming over time but not the fan-out across Services.

## [1.37.4] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed

- The delisted-symbol check-candle mute now actually holds. `updateCandle` cleared `consecutiveCandleFailures` unconditionally, and both "serve last candle" fallbacks call it with a fabricated flat candle (`lastCandle.close`, volume 0) — no new data arrived, but the streak reset anyway. For a delisted symbol those alternate with real failures, so the mute *and* the 15min backoff re-armed forever: one delisted symbol re-logged "suppressing further errors" endlessly and accounted for essentially all of the indicator worker's error output. Synthetic fills no longer clear the streak. Same bug class as the 1.36.2 ESUSDT fix, which only half-closed it.

### Added

- `InternalIndicatorsFactory.closeDeletedPairs()` tears down the indicator Services of a delisted pair. The `deletePairs` signal on `updateexchangeInfo` was consumed only by bot workers, so Services outlived their pair: they probed a dead symbol forever and — worse — kept publishing fabricated flat indicator values (volume 0 → VO -100, frozen ADX) to live subscribers as if they were real output. Wired up in main-app's indicators process.

## [1.37.3] - 2026-07-25

### Fixed

- A transient `getExchangeInfo` miss no longer poisons the funding registry for the life of the bot. On Kraken and Hyperliquid `toFundingSymbol` fell back to the raw pair when the exchange code couldn't be resolved, and the subscription heartbeat then re-wrote that member every 60s so it never aged out of the cron's stale window — the hourly funding poll rejected it on every run, forever (a handful of symbols, each a guaranteed failure every hour). The lookup now retries forced before giving up, and an unresolved code skips the funding subscription instead of registering a symbol the exchange can't answer. Same transient-miss hazard as 1.37.2, different consumer.

### Changed

- The funding cron's provider-error log now carries the symbol and the reason. `[Funding] Provider X response error NOTOK` named neither, so a single poisoned symbol failing identically every hour was indistinguishable from provider-wide degradation, and log triage re-raised it every run with no way to converge.

## [1.37.2] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed

- A DCA/Combo bot no longer auto-removes a pair from `settings.pair` (or force-closes/stops on it) while that pair still has an open deal. A transient `getExchangeInfo` miss (or a genuine delist) used to strip the pair and orphan the live position — desyncing settings from reality and breaking the deal's fee/price display. Open-deal pairs are now always kept; a delisted pair with an open deal simply has no live price (inherent), rather than being cancelled or dropped.

## [1.37.1] - 2026-07-20

### Changed

- `restoreDeal` now reactivates a canceled deal **in place**, inside its own bot, instead of spawning a new terminal bot. It flips the canceled deal back to `open` as a bare position (no DCA/TP/SL, close markers cleared) and reloads the bot so its worker re-adopts the existing position. A deal that lived in a bot is restored in that bot; a terminal deal is restored in the terminal.

## [1.37.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- `restoreDeal` mutation: re-activates a canceled DCA or terminal deal by re-adopting its existing (still on-exchange) position as a fresh bare terminal deal — no DCA, take profit or stop loss. Reuses the proven terminal-import path (`terminalDealType: import`) that `moveDealToTerminal` uses, minus the source-cancel step (the deal is already canceled). Rejects non-canceled deals.

## [1.36.2] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed

- Indicator `checkCandle` no longer floods the log with per-candle `<symbol>@<tf>@<exchange> error: parameter … does not exist` for delisted / no-archive-data symbols (e.g. ESUSDT@bitget). It now logs the first few consecutive failures then falls silent, and backs the retry cadence off to ~15m; any successful candle (live stream or archive) re-arms logging and normal cadence. Tunable via `INDICATOR_CHECK_FAIL_LOG_LIMIT` / `INDICATOR_CHECK_FAIL_BACKOFF_AFTER` / `INDICATOR_CHECK_FAIL_BACKOFF_MS`.

## [1.36.1] - 2026-07-17

### Fixed

- Fill-failsafe resting-order lookup no longer scans the whole `orders` collection: added a partial index on the resting LIMIT statuses. The query ran every 30s, examining the whole collection to return a small number of rows, and dominated slow-query time.

## [1.36.0] - 2026-07-17

### Added

- Active-sessions API: `activeSessions` query lists a user's live login sessions (device, approx location, IP, login method, sign-in time), plus `revokeSession` and `logoutOtherSessions` mutations to sign out one or all other sessions. Admin-impersonation and demo sessions are filtered out of the list, and `logoutOtherSessions` preserves them. Each `tokens[]` entry now records `ip` + `userAgent` at login; device labels reuse a shared `describeUserAgent` helper and location reuses the per-IP cache already on the user doc.

## [1.35.5] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed

- Bot permanent-delete no longer orphans deal/transaction ledgers. `premanenetlyDeleteBots` now purges `dcadeals`, `transactions` and `combotransactions` by `botId` in the per-bot cascade (alongside orders/events/messages), bounded to the bots being GC'd — previously these were left only to the weekly orphan-sweep, which never removed them (see next), so a large share of the documents in those collections were left orphaned by hard-deleted bots.
- Combo orphan-sweeps (`combotransactions`/`comboMinigrid`/`comboProfit`) were no-ops: each `$lookup ... as: 'combobot'` but `$match`ed a non-existent `bot` field (`{$size:0}`), matching nothing. Corrected the match field to `combobot` so the sweeps actually flag orphans.

## [1.35.4] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- `getPortfolioByUser` gains `includeAssets` (default true). When false, the CH read returns just `{updateTime,totalUsd}` from the `total_usd` column (no `raw` parse) — a much smaller payload for the common all-coins/all-exchanges chart line. The dashboard omits assets for the unfiltered line and requests them only when a coin/exchange filter is active.
- Per-user cache on the snapshot CH read (`snapshotReadSeries`/`snapshotReadPerExchange`), Redis-backed, TTL `SNAPSHOT_CH_CACHE_TTL` (default 300s; 0 disables). The series is daily-immutable so a short TTL is safe; cache/RPC failures fall through to a direct read then Mongo.

## [1.35.3] - 2026-07-16

### Changed

- Un-archiving a bot now resets its `updated` timestamp, giving it a fresh stopped-age window. Auto-archive keys off `updated` (the last-activity proxy), so without this a bot that had been long-stopped would be re-archived on the next hourly cron immediately after un-archiving. `setArchiveStatus` sets `updated` only on un-archive (no-op on archive), across all bot types.

## [1.35.2] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- `botMessage` gains an optional `count` field for digest-style notices (the message text carries the wording; count is bookkeeping so a daily aggregate can be incremented).

## [1.35.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Snapshot ClickHouse read now returns the FULL snapshot doc (incl. `assets[]`) from the lossless `raw` column instead of only `updateTime`+`totalUsd`. The portfolio widget needs `assets` for per-coin/per-exchange filtering; the trimmed shape crashed it (`Cannot read properties of null (reading 'map')`).

## [1.35.0] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Portfolio-snapshot cloud ClickHouse mirror (dual-write). `userSnapshots` now also ships each snapshot + per-exchange point to a buffered, fire-and-forget `SnapshotClient` (no-op unless `SNAPSHOT_CH_ENABLED`); Mongo stays source-of-truth on both editions. New `snapshotTypes`/`snapshotClient`/`snapshotRead`/`snapshotBackfill` under `src/archive`. `getPortfolioByUser` + `getSnapshotPerExchange` read the series from the CH mirror when enabled (12-month retention) and fall back to Mongo on any failure; `getPortfolioByUser` gains optional `from`/`to` to reach beyond the default 30-day window. Account reset/GDPR purges the mirror (scoped by paperContext).

### Changed

- Snapshots Mongo TTL is now env-driven (`SNAPSHOT_MONGO_TTL_DAYS`, default 365d) instead of hardcoded 90d — cloud sets a thin 7-day hot buffer once the CH mirror serves history; self-hosted keeps the full 12 months in Mongo.

## [1.34.6] - 2026-07-15

### Added

- Weekly clean job now trims `botprofitcharts` older than 12 months. The collection stores a numeric epoch-ms `time` (no Date field), so a TTL index is impossible and it was never pruned anywhere — it grew unbounded for every bot (open, stopped, and archived alike, since archiving does not move it to cold storage). The delete drains in 5,000-doc batches so the first run on a never-pruned collection can't become one lock-holding `deleteMany`.

## [1.34.5] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Archiving a bot with a very large order history (tens of thousands of orders) no longer silently fails to move that history to cold storage. The cold-store copy sent each page of up to 20,000 orders as a single RabbitMQ message (~14 MB for a big bot), which could close the RPC channel ("no response") and leave the bot's history in Mongo. The default page size is now 3,000 (≈2 MB/message); override with `COLD_STORE_PAGE`.

## [1.34.4] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Hedge archive hardening (defense-in-depth over v1.34.3). The `changeStatus` fallback that writes `closed` for a hedge bot not found in the orchestrator's in-memory list (`Bot.changeStatus`, hedgeCombo/hedgeDca branches) now filters on `status: { $ne: archive }`, so a stray close signal for an archived hedge bot can never silently un-archive it. Complements the worker-side `MetaBot.updateBotData` guard.

## [1.34.3] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- Hedge bots can now be archived reliably. The hedge parent engine (`MetaBot.updateBotData`) no longer demotes a user-set `archive` status back to a runtime status: archiving a just-stopped hedge bot raced with the post-stop child-bot stop signals (`stopFromChildBot`/`setStatus` persisting `closed`/`open`), which landed after the archive write and silently un-archived the bot (it reverted to `closed` and reappeared in the active list). Any non-archive status write from the worker is now guarded with `status: { $ne: archive }` so it can't overwrite `archive`. (Worker-path change — takes effect after a hedge bot-worker restart.)

## [1.34.2] - 2026-07-15

### Changed

- Bot collections (grid/DCA/combo/hedge) gained compound indexes `{userId, status, created}` and `{userId, created}` so the bot-list queries serve their default `created` sort from an index instead of an in-memory sort over all of a user's bots. Indexes build automatically on next connect via the existing `syncIndexes` boot path.
- The bot-list functions skip the redundant per-request `countDocuments` when the caller isn't paginating and the result fits under the limit (`total` = result length); paginated calls and limit-hitting results still get a real count (now via a count-only query instead of a second full fetch).

## [1.34.1] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Cold-store un-archive (rehydrate) no longer re-validates restored docs against the Mongoose schema. `MongoCrud.bulkUpsertById` now passes `skipValidation: true` — a rehydrate is a FAITHFUL RESTORE of docs that were already valid when archived, not new data; re-validating would reject a legitimately-restored order/transaction if the schema had tightened (a required field added) after it was archived, breaking un-archive (and the retroactive backfill of older archived bots). Casting (`_id` string→ObjectId, ISO→Date) still runs. Caught by the full archive↔un-archive E2E against real Mongo+ClickHouse.

## [1.34.0] - 2026-07-14

### Added

- Cold store PART 2 — archive is now **reversible**. New `ColdStoreRehydrator` (`archive/coldStoreRehydrator.ts`) is the inverse of the archiver: on un-archive of a cold bot it pages the bot's rows back from ClickHouse, upserts them into Mongo by original `_id` (new idempotent `MongoCrud.bulkUpsertById`), verifies the Mongo copy, clears `coldArchived`, then GCs the CH copies — fail-safe ordering (flag cleared before the CH delete, so a crash only ever leaves harmless CH orphans). `Bot.setArchiveStatus` no longer rejects un-archiving a cold bot; it rehydrates synchronously first (rejects only if the restore fails).
- `ColdStoreArchiver.backfillArchivedBots()` — one-time, resumable/idempotent retroactive backfill over every already-archived grid/dca/combo bot not yet in CH (id-paged; failed bots retried next run).
- `ColdStoreReconciler` (`archive/coldStoreReconciler.ts`) — periodic CH↔Mongo orphan sweep: GCs CH rows whose Mongo bot is gone or no longer `coldArchived`, and logs Mongo bots flagged `coldArchived` with no CH rows. Wired into the daily clean cron (flag-gated).
- Cold RPC surface: `coldDeleteByUser` (whole-account CH purge, GDPR) and `coldListBots` (distinct (userId,botId) for the sweep), mirrored byte-identically in `market-archive/src/types.ts` (Danger List §6).

### Changed

- Every real-data delete path now purges CH too. `resetUser` (the shared chokepoint for the automatic inactive hard-reset, the settings-driven live/whole reset, and account deletion) `coldDelete`s the user's just-deleted botIds on live/whole resets — mirroring the Mongo delete (idempotent, non-fatal, no-op for paper/non-cold bots).

## [1.33.1] - 2026-07-14

### Fixed

- Transient "Exchange info not found" ("Cannot find exchange for bot") no longer silently stops/closes live bots. `getExchangeInfo` can momentarily return undefined for a valid, listed pair during a resume herd (worker restart → many concurrent `pairs` reads, cold cache), and the `pairsNotFound` paths treated that as "pair gone" → dropped it from settings and stopped the bot. New `MainBot.confirmPairMissing()` re-verifies with forced reads + an active re-fill + backoff before a pair is declared missing; only genuinely-absent pairs are dropped. Wired into DCA `checkSettingsPairs`, the DCA deal-load loop, and the combo minigrid load. Fast per-tick skip paths (placeOrders/fee) are unchanged so they stay cheap.

## [1.33.0] - 2026-07-13

### Changed

- Bot-error BEHAVIOUR is now data-driven. `handleErrors` no longer hardcodes per-subType branches for visibility / error-state / message; it consults the `boterrorsubtypes` collection (via `errorRulesCache`) for `{showUser, errorsBot, userMessage}`. `errorsBot:false` keeps the bot running (warning, no error state), `showUser:false` suppresses the user message + bot event, `userMessage` rewrites the shown text. FAIL-SAFE: an unclassified subType keeps today's defaults (shown, errors bot, raw message); a static fallback mirrors the migrated hardcoded behaviours until the DB cache loads, so a restart never briefly flips a benign error into a hard error. The leverage-misconfig `Futures position` case stays a visible hard error (excluded from the suppression path); the `Indicators error:` prefix-strip stays a code transform.
- `errorRulesCache` now also loads the `boterrorsubtypes` behaviour table and counts rule HITS at the write path (once per real error occurrence, batched + flushed on the TTL) so the stored rule carries a meaningful fire count instead of always 0.

## [1.32.7] - 2026-07-12

### Changed

- Indicator candle warmup now requests Bitget (spot + futures) in 1000-candle chunks instead of the default 200. Bitget's recent `/market/candles` serves up to 1000/call and the connector now pages spot at 1000, so a warmup that falls through to the exchange (archive miss) makes ~5x fewer exchange-balancer round-trips. Reads that hit the market-archive are unaffected (already served from ClickHouse).

## [1.32.6] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed

- `withUsd` valuation now also applies to the **public** `/api/v2/user/balances` (v2/api.ts) — the prior 1.32.5 change only touched the legacy v1 `/api/user/balances` handler, which api.gainium.io does not serve.

## [1.32.5] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- `/api/user/balances` optional `?withUsd=true` — adds `price` + `usdValue` per balance, valued via the same authoritative path the snapshot cron uses (cached `getAllPrices` rate table + tokenized-stock fallback off the `pairs` collection). Default response unchanged. New exported `priceBalancesUsd` in `utils/user`.

## [1.32.4] - 2026-07-12

### Fixed

- Kraken spot order reconcile (`_handleUnknownOrder`) now resolves by the stored exchange txid instead of the Gainium client id, matching the central `getOrder` wrapper. Kraken has no native client-id lookup, so the connector resolves spot orders by `userref = parseInt(clientId.slice(0,8),16)`, which collapses every combo/grid/dca id to one shared userref (all `CMB-*` → 12) — a status/cancel poll by client id could then "not find" a live order or return a *different* order's fill data (ledger drift). `byId` now includes `ExchangeEnum.kraken` (spot only) so the reconcile path swaps the client id for the txid and routes through the connector's exact `isKrakenSpotTxid` lookup.

## [1.32.3] - 2026-07-12

### Changed

- Benign transient bot errors are no longer shown to users or flipped into an error status — they're kept in `botmessages` (`showUser:false`) for our tracking only. Applies to Hyperliquid `unknownOid` (order status couldn't be read back; self-resolves) and the reduce/close-only rejections where the position is already gone/zero (`futuresPosition` subtype, excluding the still-user-facing "Leverage cannot exceed"). `unknownOid` is now classified as the `Order processing` subtype.

### Fixed

- Combo bots now self-clear a transient `error` status on a clean price tick, mirroring DCA (`restoreFromRangeOrError` on success). Previously the combo engine only restored from `range`, never `error`, so a benign error left the bot stuck wearing the error badge until a full reload even though it kept operating.

## [1.32.2] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Expose `coldArchived` on the `fullBot`/`fullDCABot`/`fullComboBot` (+ hedge) GraphQL types so the dashboard can render archived cold-store bots as read-only (hide un-archive). Additive nullable field; resolvers return it straight off the bot doc.

## [1.32.1] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed

- Grid bot creation (`createBot`) now resolves `symbol.baseAsset`/`symbol.quoteAsset` from the authoritative `pairs` collection instead of trusting client-supplied strings. Dash-delimited Coinbase symbols (e.g. `SOL-EUR`) were being stored as `baseAsset:"SOLEUR"`/`quoteAsset:""`, causing intermittent "orders validation failed: quoteAsset is required" warnings and dropped grid orders. Falls back to the supplied values when the pair isn't found (mirrors `prepareDCABot`/`prepareComboBot`).

## [1.32.0] - 2026-07-11

### Added

- Cold store (phase 3): archived bots' order/transaction history moves to ClickHouse. On archive, `Bot.setArchiveStatus` fires a per-bot copy-verify-delete pipeline (`ColdStoreArchiver`) that batches rows to market-archive over new `coldStore*` RPC queues, verifies parity, then deletes from Mongo. Drill-down reads (`getBotOrders`/`getDealOrders`/`getComboDealOrders`/`getBotTransactions`) route archived (cold) bots to CH with Mongo fallback; bot-delete GC batches a CH `DELETE WHERE botId IN(…)`. Gated on `COLD_STORE_ENABLED` (default off; self-hosted stays wholly in Mongo). New `coldArchived` bot flag makes newly-archived bots READ-ONLY / one-way (clone to reuse); existing archived bots are grandfathered. Grid/dca/combo only (hedge deferred). Canonical wire contract in `src/archive/coldTypes.ts` (mirrored in market-archive).

## [1.31.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- Bot-error subType classification now consults the DB-backed `boterrorrules` collection first (seeded out of band and extendable without a code change). Rules relabel newly-stored errors with no deploy — a 5-min self-priming, non-blocking cache (`errorRulesCache`) refreshes in the background, falling through to the static `errorDict` until first load. Reduces `Uncategorized` and lets a mislabel be corrected without a release. NB: takes effect only after a bot-worker restart (ships the rules-aware code); rule *additions* thereafter need no restart.

## [1.30.3] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed

- Kraken Futures rate-limit `apiLimitExceeded` is now categorized (`Exchange rate limit`) instead of falling through to `Uncategorized`. `handleErrors` treats it as a transient, non-erroring warning ("Exchange temporarily rate-limited our requests… retried automatically") so the bot no longer hard-errors/stops the deal on a rate-limit that the connector already retries.

## [1.30.2] - 2026-07-04

### Changed

- Bot events (30d), rates (30d) and snapshots (90d) now expire via TTL indexes (declared in `registerIndexes()`) instead of weekly bulk `deleteMany` age-scans in `cleanJob`. Expiry runs continuously in the background rather than as a weekly spike. The conditional cleanup steps (paper/balances/fees/orphaned-bot data) and the bot-*warning* 14d delete (a subset the 30d TTL can't express) are unchanged.

## [1.30.1] - 2026-07-07

### Fixed

- Portfolio snapshot now values tokenized-stock holdings (Kraken xStocks, Bybit spot xstocks, Hyperliquid spot RWA) instead of dropping them at $0. The snapshot builder priced every balance off the bulk `getAllPrices` rate table, which carries no xStock; unpriceable holdings were skipped entirely, so they vanished from the portfolio. Now a holding whose (exchange, pair-base) matches a `stock`/`etf` pair is priced via that exchange's live `latestPrice` ticker (cached per pair per run). `normalizeStockTicker` also strips Kraken's tokenized-ledger `.T` suffix (`PGx.T` → `PG`), and a new `balanceAssetToPairBase` maps a ledger code to its tradeable pair base (`PGx.T` → `PGx`).

## [1.30.0] - 2026-07-07

### Added

- In-memory RPC-latency counters in `Rabbit` (`getRpcLatencyStats()`): `sendWithCallback` tallies per-queue `{count,sumMs,maxMs,breaches,timeouts}` on completion (breach when round-trip > `RPC_LATENCY_BREACH_MS`, default 10000) and on hard-timeout rejection. Module-level (all instances aggregate), additive, never-throw; consumed by main-app's RPC-latency monitor. No existing method signature changed.

## [1.29.1] - 2026-07-06

### Changed

- Pairs dedup in indicator service

## [1.29.0] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- Pairs now carry an optional `baseAsset.displayName` (human-readable asset name, e.g. "Apple Inc." / "Bitcoin") — added to the `pairs` schema/type and exposed on the `baseAssetPair`/`baseAssetInPair` GraphQL types. Additive & optional: absent until the main-app `saveAssetNames` cron resolves it; consumers fall back to the ticker (`name`). Exchanges don't return names, so they're resolved from a reference source (coins collection for crypto, curated ticker→name map for stocks), mirroring the icon pipeline.

## [1.28.3] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- Tokenized-stock (xStocks) icons: `normalizeStockTicker` now strips the `x`/`X` wrapper from dotted tickers (`BRK.Bx` → `BRK.B`) so the `/icons/stock/:ticker` route resolves the real brand logo instead of a monogram. Kept in lock-step with the main-dash-sh frontend copy.


## [1.28.2] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed

- Kraken spot deal fills silently dropped. Kraken spot has no `cl_ord_id`, so user-stream execution reports carry the Kraken txid as their clientOrderId — the stream matcher (keyed by our `D-…`/`GRID-…` client id) never matched, so resting-limit fills never registered. `convertExecutionReportToOrder` now falls back to matching by exchange `orderId` (txid) for Kraken spot when the client-id lookups miss. Also `mergeCommonOrderWithOrder` now preserves the local order's `clientOrderId` instead of the exchange-echoed one (no-op for other exchanges; prevents rekey/DB corruption on the Kraken reconcile path, which resolves by txid). Pairs with exchange-connector core 1.14.3.

## [1.28.1] - 2026-07-06

### Added

- streamWatchdog: actions carry a reason tag (stale vs catchRate) and main() accepts an onAction ops-visibility hook (fire-and-forget) so escalations can be surfaced by the host application

## [1.28.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added
- Missed-fill failsafe escalation (spec §3.4) in the stream watchdog: a second, independent signal source alongside staleness. On each tick it groups recent `reconcilesweepcatches` by `exchangeUUID` over `FF_ESCALATE_WINDOW_MS` (default 24h, excludes paper) and, for chronic offenders, triggers a stream self-heal once (`FF_ESCALATE_SELFHEAL_N`, default 3) then INFORM USERS once (`FF_ESCALATE_INFORM_N`, default 3 more after the self-heal). Escalation state rides in the existing `watchdogState` hash via two new optional fields (`ffSelfHealAt`, `ffInformAt`); the decision is a pure function (`catchRateTick`) and never touches the staleness `failureCount`/backoff or emits a reconcile.

### Changed
- INFORM USERS bot error now links a troubleshooting article (`STREAM_TROUBLESHOOTING_URL`, default `https://docs.gainium.io/troubleshooting/exchange-connection-updates`) covering outdated API key formats and missing exchange IP whitelists.

### Removed
- Hyperliquid blunt order poller (`startHyperliquidOrderPoll` / `pollHyperliquidOrdersFn` / `maybeEmitHyperliquidPolledOrder` and the `HYPERLIQUID_POLL_ORDERS` gate) — superseded by the price-gated fill-failsafe detector.

## [1.27.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- Pairs now carry an `isCanonical` flag (Hyperliquid spot only: HL-canonical or Unit-bridged = true; permissionless HIP-1 = false; absent elsewhere = canonical), persisted and exposed on `getAllPairs`, for the dashboard "Canonical only" pair-picker toggle. Paper twins mirror their real twin's flag (and `assetCategory`) since paper-trading proxies exchange-info without either signal.

## [1.26.1] - 2026-07-04

### Fixed
- Never store a negative `locked` in the `balances` collection. `locked` (funds reserved by open orders/positions) is written verbatim from authoritative sources that can go negative — Binance futures `ACCOUNT_UPDATE` (`walletBalance - crossWalletBalance`, negative on positive unrealized PnL) and the connector's Hyperliquid futures balance (`accountValue - withdrawable`) — which made "available" balance display wrong/negative on heavy-churn accounts. Clamp `locked` to `≥ 0` at every write boundary in the balance-update path (`utils/user.ts`).

## [1.26.0] - 2026-07-04

### Added
- OKX Europe (`okxSource=my`) authoritative spot pairs. Pairs now carry an optional `source` field (`my` = OKX Europe / eea.okx.com USDC/EUR spot universe; unset = global feed + all other exchanges), exposed on `getAllPairs`. New `updateOkxEuPairs()` fetches an EU account's account-scoped instruments (via the connector's `/exchange/account`) and reconciles them into the shared `pairs` collection tagged `source: my` — the set is account-agnostic, so the first EU account to connect refreshes it for every EU user. The exchange client gains `getAccountSpotExchangeInfo()` (private call; non-OKX exchanges get a not-supported default).

## [1.25.2] - 2026-07-03

### Changed
- Deals list REST (`GET /api/v2/deals/:dealType`): cache the exact total count in Redis (60s TTL, keyed on the query filter) instead of running a full `countDocuments` on every page load. The `meta.count`/`meta.total` response stays exact within the TTL; the page rows are still fetched live. Cache is best-effort — any Redis error falls back to a live count. Removes the per-request count aggregation that dominated the Mongo slow log for large accounts.

## [1.25.1] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- Register five query indexes in `registerIndexes()`, matching indexes commonly created by hand: `dcaBot {uuid}`, `botMessage {botId, isDeleted}`, `dcaDeal {userId, createTime}` (partial on `status: 'open'`), and `transaction`/`comboTransaction {botId, userId}`. Eliminates COLLSCANs on the webhook bot-lookup and bot-error message soft-delete, removes the in-memory sort on the deals list, and lets the bot engine load a single bot's transactions instead of scanning the whole user's. All indexed fields are static/write-once (no write-path regression). No-op where the indexes are already present; first-boot build on self-hosted/local.

## [1.25.0] - 2026-07-03

### Added
- User Stream Watchdog. 

## [1.24.3] - 2026-07-03

### Fixed
- Archiving a running bot now fails with a clear "Only stopped bots can be archived. Stop the bot first." error instead of silently reporting success and reappearing after a re-login/browser reopen. `setArchiveStatus` filtered the update on `status: closed`, so archiving a running bot (e.g. a hedge-combo bot) matched 0 docs yet still returned OK — the dashboard showed a false success and hid the bot locally until the next full reload. The legacy rule (only stopped bots are archivable) is preserved; the failure is now explicit and nothing is mutated on a rejected archive. Applies to all bot types (DCA/Grid/Combo/Hedge Combo/Hedge DCA).

## [1.24.2] - 2026-07-02

### Changed
- (Superseded by 1.24.3 — not deployed) Dropped the `status: closed` guard so archiving worked on bots in any active state. Replaced by an explicit error, to keep the legacy "stop before archiving" rule.

## [1.24.1] - 2026-07-02

### Fixed
- Combo bot stop: `ComboBot.afterBotStop()` now delegates to `super.afterBotStop()`, so stopping a combo bot also clears the price timer and reconcile-sweep interval (previously left running — combo arms both via the inherited DCA `start()`).

## [1.24.0] - 2026-07-02

### Added
- Binance Futures Quantitative Rules (-4400) cooldown guard: violations are tracked per account+symbol in Redis (`QuantRulesGuard`), mirroring Binance's tiers (L1 symbol 5min, L2 symbol 2h after 10 violations/24h, L3 whole-account 2h at 10+ restricted symbols). During a cooldown, non-reduceOnly Binance-futures orders are delayed (pre-send gate + bounded deferred retry) instead of hammering the exchange; the -4400 rejection no longer errors the bot — it emits a once-per-window warning. Deferred retries are cancelled on bot stop and dropped when the deal closed meanwhile. New `quantrulesevents` collection (90d TTL) and `getQuantRulesStatus` GraphQL query for the dashboard banner. Additive `subType` field on the `bot message` socket payload.

## [1.23.2] - 2026-07-01

### Fixed
- Stock/ETF icons: `normalizeStockTicker` now strips a Hyperliquid HIP-3 builder-dex prefix (`xyz:AAPL` → `AAPL`) so tokenized-stock perps resolve their clean ticker for logo lookup.

## [1.23.1] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- Stock/ETF icons: venue-gate `normalizeStockTicker` so Bitget reality (`RAAPL`), Bybit-spot xstock (`AAPLX`) and Kraken xStock (`AAPLX` on `krakenUsdm`) bases resolve to their clean ticker for logo lookup. Upper-case wrapper strips (`R`-prefix / `X`-suffix) are gated to the venue that mints them — and to its `paper` twin — so clean tickers that start with `R` (`RBLX`) or end in `X` (`NFLX` on `bybitLinear`) are no longer mangled; lower-case wrappers (`rTSLA`/`AAPLx`/`AAPLon`) still strip on any venue.

## [1.23.0] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- Normalized `assetCategory` (crypto/stock/etf/commodity/metal/forex/index, default crypto) on the `pairs` collection + `getAllPairs` GraphQL, classified authoritatively from the connector's `assetClass` (no heuristics). `classifyAssetClass` trusts the exchange signal; the pairs cron persists it and paper exchanges inherit their real twin's class.

## [1.22.4] - 2026-06-29

### Fixed
- Pin the reconcile-sweep collection name explicitly to `reconcilesweepcatches`. Mongoose lowercases derived model collection names (e.g. `dcaBots` → `dcabots`), so the previously-configured `reconcileSweepCatches` model would have written live catches to a lowercased collection that the reader/backfill didn't match — the reader would have shown backfilled history but never live data. Now both sides use the same explicit lowercase name.

## [1.22.3] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- Persist reconciliation-sweep catches to the `reconcileSweepCatches` collection (`MainBot.recordReconcileSweepCatch`, fire-and-forget at the grid/DCA catch sites) — `botId/botType/userId/exchange/exchangeUUID/paperContext/pair/missedFills`, 90-day TTL. A rising per-account catch rate = that account's user stream is silently dead. No-op when `RECONCILE_SWEEP_ENABLED` is off.

## [1.22.2] - 2026-06-28

### Changed
- Reconciliation sweep (1.22.0) moved from `BotOperations` (worker bot-service) to the per-instance `MainBot` base class (`startReconcileSweep`/`stopReconcileSweep`, armed in `runAfterLoading()` + grid/DCA start, cleared on stop). The cloud build runs bots in-process via the `src/bot/` overlay, so the worker path never executed there; the per-instance timer runs wherever the bot instance runs, so the sweep now works in **both cloud and self-hosted**. Adds greppable logs: `reconcile-sweep armed (every Xms)` per bot on load, and `reconcile-sweep caught N missed fill(s)` when the sweep (not a reconnect) reconciled a stream-dropped fill.

## [1.22.1] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed
- Merging deals on a hedge bot (DCA or Combo) now tags the resulting merged deal with its hedge wrapper id (`parentBotId`). Previously the merged deal was created without it, so the `hedge*DealList` queries — which select hedge-leg deals via `parentBotId: { $exists: true }` — dropped it, and the merged deal never appeared in the hedge bot's Deals view in the new dashboard (it only surfaced in the legacy UI).

## [1.22.0] - 2026-06-28

### Added
- Opt-in Tier-2 reconciliation sweep (`RECONCILE_SWEEP_ENABLED`, interval `RECONCILE_SWEEP_INTERVAL_MS`): a per-worker timer periodically re-runs each running grid/DCA bot's existing reconnect reconcile, so order fills missed by a silently-dead user stream are caught within one interval instead of stalling the bot until a manual restart. Off by default; jittered + overlap-guarded; routed through the per-bot mutex.

### Fixed
- `checkOrdersAfterReconnect` (grid + DCA) and `checkOrders` (grid) now reset `blockCheck` via `try/catch/finally`. A throw mid-check previously left `blockCheck` stuck `true`, silently freezing all subsequent order checks for that bot — turning a transient reconnect-reconcile error into a permanent stall.

## [1.21.0] - 2026-06-25

### Added
- Paper `SPOT & Futures` accounts can be funded independently per market (SPOT / USDⓈ-M / COIN-M) via an optional `topUps` array on `addExchange`; omitting it preserves the previous single-top-up behavior

## [1.20.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- Get funding rate history

## [1.19.1] - 2026-06-13

### Fixed
- REST-API multi-TP/SL validation rejected every real UUID (compared uuid values against the key allowlist)

## [1.19.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added
- Snapshots per exchange

## [1.18.10] - 2026-06-12

### Changed
- Reset user process

## [1.18.9] - 2026-06-11

### Fixed
- DIV indicator logic

## [1.18.8] - 2026-06-10

### Changed

- Backtester performance fix. 

## [1.18.7] - 2026-06-10

### Changed

- Enable gzip/deflate compression on all API responses (`compression`
  middleware). The large `getAllPairs` payload (~3.4MB) and other big JSON
  responses now transfer ~15x smaller, cutting response time from several
  seconds to sub-second.

## [1.18.6] - 2026-06-09

### Fixed

- A manual add/reduce-funds failure on a deal is now always reported to the
  user, even when a same-type message (e.g. "Not enough balance") is already
  active for the bot. Previously the error de-duplication gate could swallow
  the user-initiated failure, leaving the terminal with no feedback.

## [1.18.5] - 2026-06-09

### Changed

- Error dictionary

## [1.18.4] - 2026-06-08

### Fixed

- Exchange disabled by host configuration for paper exchanges

## [1.18.3] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Hyperliquid builder fees

## [1.18.2] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Expose `paperContext` on `dcaDeal`/`comboDeal` GraphQL types and stamp it on
  returned deals (list + per-bot, incl. hedge) so clients can tell a deal's
  trading context without inferring it. Additive/backward-compatible.

## [1.18.1] - 2026-05-31

### Added

- `getBotEvents`: optional `category` input (`recent`/`deals`/`alerts`) and a
  `counts` response field for server-side categorization. `recent` is the full
  feed (no filter); `alerts` = error/warning type; `deals` = deal-tied events
  that aren't alerts. Counts are computed only when `category` is supplied, so
  callers that don't request them are unaffected (no extra count queries).

## [1.18.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- Self-hosted admin-config sync (gated by `ADMIN_CONFIG_ENABLED`). Reads
  `gainium:admin:enabled_exchanges` from Redis, subscribes to
  `gainium:admin:config` pubsub, and runs a 10s periodic refresh as a
  safety net. When the flag is off (cloud / unflagged) every code path
  is a hard no-op — no extra Redis traffic, no timers, no log lines.

## [1.17.10] - 2026-05-28

### Changed

- Enforce profitCurrency and orderFixedIn on server side for grid bot.

## [1.17.9] - 2026-05-26
